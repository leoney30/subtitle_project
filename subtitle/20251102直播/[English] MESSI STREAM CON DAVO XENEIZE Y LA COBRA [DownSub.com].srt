1
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:04,080
DAVO: Suárez just came out, tell him, the Uruguayan "truco" (card game) is shit

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,132
I mean, its so difficult to understood

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:10,000
RAFA: The Argentine "truco" is like the Uruguayan "truco" but for children.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,799
No, seriously I'm telling you, it's the Uruguayan "truco"

5
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:14,000
for children. when you are

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,440
small and you can't understand how to play

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,439
Uruguayan "truco", they teach you the Argentine "truco"

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,240
COBRA: But which came first, Rafa?

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,429
DAVO: I like the Uruguayan "truco" the same, Rafa.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,320
Rafa, sorry, sorry. Suárez just left

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,720
take a second to look for something to drink.

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,427
and he just said that the Uruguayan "truco" is a bullshit.

14
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:33,394
Luis appeared and just said

15
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:36,399
which is very good. Did you hear it?

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,593
RAFA: Yes. Because he's a drag...

17
00:00:37,593 --> 00:00:41,039
DAVO: You're a stupid snitch!
COBRA: Suck-up. average suck-up.

18
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:41,800
He's a mean sucker.

19
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,089
DAVO: And you are a stupid snitch.

20
00:00:43,089 --> 00:00:46,138
COBRA: No, idiot. But I tell it like it is.

21
00:00:46,138 --> 00:00:48,520
RAFA: Do you know what we have to do Luis?

22
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,520
You and I against Davo and Cobra.

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,079
Or the Davo and the Cobra choose one

24
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:59,800
and you tell your partner, you have to tell him two things,

25
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,960
enter streaming now

26
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,600
and play a "truco" game,

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,479
Uruguay - Argentina

28
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:07,560
and we played a Uruguayan-style game

29
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,520
and an Argentine-style match.

30
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,000
SUAREZ: No, but the Uruguayan needs time, idiot

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,439
to learn

32
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:17,430
RAFA: well, let them handle themselves. Look how crazy they are,

33
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,252
Hey? Davo streams 4 hours a day

34
00:01:19,252 --> 00:01:20,640
and gets up at 5 in the afternoon

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,699
and the other one you have in the next room

36
00:01:22,699 --> 00:01:24,720
Practice for an hour and a half. It's not that hard either

37
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,844
in construction, huh?

38
00:01:27,844 --> 00:01:30,000
SUAREZ: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,640
MESSI: What are you talking about? Of me?

40
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,320
RAFA: Look.

41
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,200
Yes of course

42
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,079
that you're on the go all day.

43
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,960
You have to learn to play the Uruguayan "truco"

44
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,563
MESSI: What happened?

45
00:01:40,563 --> 00:01:41,960
Good morning, people.

46
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,200
COBRA: What are you doing, Leo? How are you?

47
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,159
DAVO: How are you doing?

48
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,880
MESSI: What's wrong, Cobra? Davo, is everything okay?

49
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,439
COBRA: Everything calm.

50
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:51,000
DAVO: Here watching the game. 2-0 25 minutes.

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,920
He scored two goals in 8 minutes, high pressure

52
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,398
and now the match was evened out a little more.

54
00:01:57,898 --> 00:02:00,320
COBRA: Analyze Davo, analyze
MESSI: Yes, I saw that he was winning 2-0

55
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,560
RAFA: but analyze and comment on the game now!

56
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,479
I was just barding with "truco" and fucking around

57
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:07,480
that the Uruguayan "truco" was shit...

58
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,052
COBRA: Goal!!!
DAVO: Goal de Deportivo LSM!   3 to 0

59
00:02:11,052 --> 00:02:13,480
MESSI: I just arrived, look.

60
00:02:14,485 --> 00:02:17,033
SUAREZ: Was it a goal? Yes, yes
COBRA: Good definition. Yes. Yes,

61
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:18,996
3 - 0.

62
00:02:18,996 --> 00:02:21,599
SUAREZ: Ah! They think as if they were...

63
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,400
good as a forward. Hey, "Nine"?

64
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,580
COBRA: Thank you, Luis. Thank you. Thanks a lot.
MESSI: Were they talking about "truco"?

66
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,560
SUAREZ: they were saying which one was better,

67
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,682
asking to see.

68
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,879
MESSI: No, , the Uruguayan "truco", I  don't understand it.

69
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,800
I had played a couple of times, but

70
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,045
COBRA: Say something, Rafa. Now let's see, say something.

71
00:02:36,045 --> 00:02:40,280
MESSI: No, I don't know but I don't understand it
RAFA: You can learn it. Look, it's not a kidney transplant.

72
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,120
You spend 15 minutes concentrating

73
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,400
if they are on the go all day.

74
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,147
15 minutes...

75
00:02:46,147 --> 00:02:50,000
MESSI: Nah well, but I saw him play a little bit there and

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,578
It's very different, very different.

77
00:02:52,578 --> 00:02:54,560
DAVO: Let there be a card that has more

78
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,300
value that Ace of spades takes away a lot of credibility.

80
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,519
COBRA: "Espadilla." "Espadilla", friend. Speak well.

82
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:03,599
RAFA: The ace. "spades ace"? What is spades ace?

83
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,197
Its called "Espadilla" and "bastillo".

84
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:07,799
[Laughs]

85
00:03:09,477 --> 00:03:13,040
SUAREZ: Listen Davo, you were speechless. Look how you can talk,

86
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,760
Hey? You can speak as you have been speaking,

87
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,879
Hey? Because you are...

88
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,172
RAFA: He's terrified, he's terrified

89
00:03:21,172 --> 00:03:23,440
COBRA: No, no, Davo didn't say what you thought about "mate" (traditional argentinian drink).

90
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,159
now that Leo is there

91
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:28,039
DAVO: I love it! It is my favorite drink.

92
00:03:31,105 --> 00:03:34,084
SUAREZ: He says he doesn't trust those who drink mate

93
00:03:34,084 --> 00:03:35,684
MESSI: Why?

94
00:03:35,684 --> 00:03:38,546
DAVO: I don't know, I never really liked mate, to be honest.
SUAREZ: That's what the Cobra said.

95
00:03:38,546 --> 00:03:42,665
COBRA: No, no, he didn't say that. He didn't say that.

96
00:03:43,851 --> 00:03:47,106
MESSI: No, but the Cobra drinks mate, yes I saw him drinking.
RAFA: You being athletes...

97
00:03:47,106 --> 00:03:49,434
Davo has healthy habits.

98
00:03:49,434 --> 00:03:51,640
Tell him, Davo, tell him what time you get up

99
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,319
and what you eat during the day.

100
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,560
DAVO: Two, three in the afternoon I start

101
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,280
and I go to bed type 6 -7 am.

102
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,879
But why, but because I stream all night.

103
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,879
MESSI: Sure. It happens

104
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,519
When you started you didn't sleep at all

105
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,079
COBRA: yes...

106
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:11,283
DAVO: Exactly, during the day there are always matches,

107
00:04:11,283 --> 00:04:12,732
You cannot stream during the day.

108
00:04:12,732 --> 00:04:14,000
The key is at night

109
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,074
that everything is over.

110
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,178
RAFA: And what do you eat? For example, you wake up and what, protein?

111
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,299
fiber? fruit?

112
00:04:25,314 --> 00:04:27,040
DAVO: What a goal!
COBRA: 4 to 0

113
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,723
SUAREZ: No! Nine again! mother fucker.

114
00:04:29,723 --> 00:04:32,056
*the 9th had a goal bonus for every goal he scored*

115
00:04:32,056 --> 00:04:37,515
RAFA: Leo... open the wallet.

116
00:04:37,515 --> 00:04:39,280
SUAREZ: Let's send a message to the Coach

117
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,880
to take him out.

118
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,738
COBRA: No! Leave it, Luis, leave it.

119
00:04:43,738 --> 00:04:45,840
MESSI: Davo, you always started

120
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,479
from the beginning, you started with

121
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:49,080
Boca Juniors streams and football?

122
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,600
DAVO: Yes, yes, yes. From the beginning.
MESSI: Since you started?

123
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,036
Yes, in fact also at that time, already in 2020

124
00:04:54,036 --> 00:04:56,320
that I started analizing football - Boca juniors at night,

125
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,000
So I adapted a little to the schedule

126
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,360
which I could stream and that was it, done.

127
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,520
I mean, I never changed the content.

128
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,172
always the same basically

129
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,738
MESSI: Are you a Madrid fan too, Davo?

130
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:09,960
COBRA: Ow, ow, ow.

131
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,529
DAVO: "too"? Who else here would be a Real Madrid fan?

132
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:13,639
not Cobrita ...

133
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,518
MESSI: Not because you are a Boca fan... We are talking about Boca

134
00:05:15,518 --> 00:05:17,125
So I say, are you also a Madrid fan?

135
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,686
DAVO: Ah! uh, no, no. Not a "Madrid FAN"

136
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,160
But I have a colleague who is

137
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,604
a huge Barça fan and I like to mess with him...

138
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:26,843
I like to mess with him when i can...

139
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,039
MESSI: Ah, that's why ...

140
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,633
DAVO: Yes, Leo, yes, please.

141
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:37,919
RAFA: You sleazebag! How scared he is!...

142
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,360
He's terrified.

143
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,868
SUAREZ: Listen , so, show us, there behind your...

144
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,225
DAVO: Two Argentines, two Boca Juniors fan...
RAFA: Yeah! back back what do you have back there?...

145
00:05:47,225 --> 00:05:48,440
DAVO: We have to compete in something...

146
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,495
SUAREZ: Behind you... behind, where is Leo's back there?  Let's see,

147
00:05:51,495 --> 00:05:54,160
Move the camera a little...

148
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,880
DAVO: There...

149
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,329
there is Román's and Diego's... and Messi's...

150
00:05:59,536 --> 00:06:00,440
It is the one from the 2010 South Africa World Cup

151
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,560
SUAREZ: No, the picture, I mean, the picture of Leo. Where is it?

152
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,360
With was back there...

153
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,910
DAVO: Oh, it happens that the one who made the mural only made Maradona.

155
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:11,069
SUAREZ: Oh, but didn't you have Leo's picture in the other house?

156
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:11,840
a picture?

157
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,800
DAVO: Yes, obviously. I had Leo first, then Román

158
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,840
and in fact I always covered Diego.

159
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,479
Leo was always seen alone...

161
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,576
Now I put Diego there.

162
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,880
SUAREZ: Yes, yes, yes, yes. That's why.

163
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,680
I was serious. I thought you had Leo's

164
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,160
with the cup

165
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,891
DAVO: No, I had that for two years in my previous setup.

166
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,078
He was always first.

168
00:06:34,721 --> 00:06:37,759
COBRA: Davo speak Spanish, please.

169
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,039
"Setup"? Remember that they are footballers. "Setup"?

170
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,759
"Setup", friend? Room.

171
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:45,479
DAVO: My streaming room. My work room.

172
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:49,443
COBRA: "My study place"
RAFA: Let's see yours, Cobra?

173
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,456
SUAREZ: He says hes a terrible striker...
MESSI: Oh Yes?

174
00:06:51,456 --> 00:06:53,960
COBRA:  I always had everything the same here.
The only thing i did...

175
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,199
I put new pictures over time.

176
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:58,400
Look, let's see if we see something there.

177
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,000
first I had Leo's with the Copa América.

178
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:02,000
There is Diego, the awards.

179
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,652
Well, then Leo is back there too...

180
00:07:03,652 --> 00:07:05,340
It's a little awkward, because Leo is listening right now

181
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,260
it's a little uncomfortable,

182
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,680
but hey, I have everything here

183
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,319
literally, that is, everything that has happened

184
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,728
I was basically adding another picture

186
00:07:14,472 --> 00:07:19,242
COBRA: Like this... Here is the picture with Leo in Miami...
SUAREZ: And you, Rafa, don't show that you rented a guesthouse to join

187
00:07:19,242 --> 00:07:23,199
RAFA: I am imprisoned, I am imprisoned.

188
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,179
Look, there's my partner.

189
00:07:26,644 --> 00:07:29,919
Yes, I have nothing. I'm in a pension, bad.

190
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,241
Look...here I am.

191
00:07:33,972 --> 00:07:37,080
There's nothing, I'm not really at home.

192
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,080
COBRA: Good wall huh,

193
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,258
nice wall color, huh?

194
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:42,360
SUAREZ: Nah, he's out, he's out... Let's thank Rafa

195
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,560
who left with his daughters and is there

196
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,220
putting all the good vibes on it.

197
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,800
RAFA: What is the worst defeat in Boca Juniors history?

198
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,120
Davo? in lost matches

199
00:07:54,263 --> 00:07:55,440
SUAREZ: He's not listening...it happens...

200
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,720
Rafa, we were talking, Rafa,

201
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,299
you are kind of old

202
00:08:00,299 --> 00:08:02,312
You're old for these streams and all that.

203
00:08:02,312 --> 00:08:04,348
You have to understand when they speak, do you understand?

204
00:08:04,348 --> 00:08:05,240
MESSI: What did you ask him?

205
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,800
RAFA: I'm outta here, I'm outta here... Ok, I'm outta here

206
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,448
SUAREZ: What did you ask, Rafa?

207
00:08:11,448 --> 00:08:14,520
RAFA: No, because Boca now is losing 4 to 0...

208
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,080
When did they lose by a bigger margin?

209
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,979
Davo knows all the statistics,

210
00:08:18,106 --> 00:08:19,000
the matches.

211
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,319
DAVO: We once lost 4 to 0 in 2005 with Chivas

212
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:25,040
in Libertadores Cup. Hard defeat.

213
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,595
COBRA: And also with a local team San Juan it wasn't 6-1? I believe.

215
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,479
DAVO: It's true. In 2013 we lost 6-1

216
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,877
with San Martín de San Juan.

217
00:08:31,877 --> 00:08:35,279
DAVO: Leo, I have a question for you.
How do you drink "mate"? however it comes?...

218
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,178
MESSI: stop, stop, stop.
What are you going to ask?

219
00:08:38,178 --> 00:08:40,279
Don't start asking, huh.

220
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:43,490
DAVO: No, no, " mate "!
MESSI: We're watching the game, eh?

222
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:49,117
RAFA: Leo shoots! Leo shoots! I love you that way, spicy.

223
00:08:49,117 --> 00:08:52,420
MESSI: Don't start it! don't start it!

224
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,845
[Laughs]

225
00:08:55,845 --> 00:08:58,845
MESSI: From the game? What?

226
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,240
DAVO: Yes, yes, yes. I was going to ask you what you think about the goal.

227
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,839
who just scored

228
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,382
COBRA: Hey! He didn't ask that!

229
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,666
MESSI: What? What happened?

230
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,880
DAVO: No, no. How do you drink "mate" , that was...

231
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,851
Sweet? bitter? as it comes...

232
00:09:16,851 --> 00:09:19,440
MESSI: Bitter, bitter.

233
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,560
At first I drank it... when I was a kid I drank it sweet,

234
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,800
my mom drank it sweet

236
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,040
and then when I started to become alone,

237
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,160
I started to drink it bitter.

238
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,000
Actually I was making it sweet and I started to drink it bitter

239
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,839
because of the sugar issue

240
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,480
and I started to drink it bitter and it stayed like that.

241
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,693
Also in Nationals team i drinked it bitter.
RAFA: And you use Uruguayan herbs? or you drink it with argentinian herbs?...

242
00:09:44,693 --> 00:09:47,017
...which is firewood

243
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,640
COBRA: Firewood?
MESSI: No, when I was in Rosario...

244
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,801
however it comes, when I was a kid. Later on...

245
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:58,600
RAFA: Now I'm not telling you,

246
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,519
I'm not asking you to say brands, I'm asking you,

247
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:02,800
Do you drink with Uruguayan herbs noww?
MESSI: yes... Uruguayan

248
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:07,160
RAFA: with real uruguayean herbs or you drink it with firewood with warm water argentinian way?

249
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,120
MESSI: Now with the Uruguayan

250
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,279
RAFA: Look...

251
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,440
COBRA: You allways want to impose something, right?

252
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,720
Rafa? all the time, Uruguayan "truco" ...

253
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,467
Uruguayan games... Uruguayan "mate".

254
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:22,040
RAFA: I am simply exposing a reality,

255
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,959
an information.

256
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:24,959
COBRA: Ah, okay...

257
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,200
RAFA: He drinks with Uruguayan herbs because its better!

258
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,260
COBRA: We don't know, he likes it better.
MESSI: Yes, it depends for whom.

260
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,160
Of course

261
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,000
COBRA: sure.

262
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,320
SUAREZ: And you Cobra?
COBRA: Eh, no, I have here

263
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,519
the one my mother gave me, I don't know,

264
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,680
It's not spacial. I don't want to say the brand

265
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,279
so that we avoid brands, but it is a...

266
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,798
supposedly one that makes me lose weight,

267
00:10:43,956 --> 00:10:47,399
but I don't think its working.

268
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:51,126
RAFA: You have to eat it, you idiot!
MESSI: I saw you sometimes...

269
00:10:51,126 --> 00:10:55,120
MESSI: I saw your "mates".
You prepare really bad ones, washed.

270
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,800
COBRA: No, stop, Leo. But well, it's just that

271
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,040
my "mates" washes off,

272
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,503
but I can't get up from the stream, you see?

274
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,802
Of course.

275
00:11:01,802 --> 00:11:03,240
COBRA: It's complicated for me...

276
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,342
MESSI: You make it last all day, of course

277
00:11:05,342 --> 00:11:07,204
COBRA: Sure, ... although sometimes im with the same "mate"

278
00:11:07,204 --> 00:11:09,800
And i recharge like 3 thermos...

279
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,868
MESSI: Sure.
SUAREZ: No, you can't, idiot!

280
00:11:11,868 --> 00:11:13,360
For that, make yourself a tea.

281
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,379
COBRA:but the problem is that I have to get up,

282
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:16,360
and it hurts my knee

283
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,560
get up very often... kindding

284
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,000
It's because I have to go down and it looks bad to leave the screen.

285
00:11:22,918 --> 00:11:26,124
That's why, seriously.

286
00:11:26,124 --> 00:11:28,680
Before I also drank sweet mate, then I switched to...

287
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,519
I became a real man and now drink it the normal way

288
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:32,968
MESSI: Well, but inland there are many people who drink it sweet.

289
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,360
COBRA: Yes, that's right.

290
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,692
DAVO: And some of them also add sweetener too.

291
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,800
MESSI: Yes.

292
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,947
RAFA: Well...

293
00:11:42,296 --> 00:11:46,279
MESSI: with Kun Aguero in Copa América

294
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:50,040
2015 in Chile,

295
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,720
I don't know why Kun...

296
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,564
It occurred to him to put honey in it.

297
00:11:54,849 --> 00:11:56,279
DAVO: No!
RAFA: Seriosly?...

298
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,279
MESSI: I drank mate with honey.

299
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,800
MESSI: He put honey in the water

300
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,842
RAFA: IN the water?

301
00:12:01,842 --> 00:12:04,290
COBRA: And you liked it?

302
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,428
MESSI: It was sweet, it was good I guess, we drank it.

303
00:12:07,428 --> 00:12:10,000
COBRA: Yes, my grandmother used to make it with honey for me at one point,

304
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,841
Literally, my grandmother, too...

305
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,240
It is a rather strange custom.
SUAREZ: I had never heard of mate with honey

306
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,560
MESSI: He put honey into the water...

307
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,959
We drank it like that the entire Copa América ...

308
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,906
in Chile.

309
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,720
COBRA: That thing, Rafa, is very Argentine, eh? Because

310
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,698
You might want to claim that for yourself too...

311
00:12:25,698 --> 00:12:28,720
RAFA: What? drinking mate with honey? Yeah,

312
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,560
It's yours. No, no, no. You keep it,

313
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,720
stay calm. We may drink it with some other herbs

314
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,507
It could be... Of course! but that's all yours

315
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:40,079
honey, sugar and sweetener,

316
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,880
especially the sweetener, adding sweetener

317
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,338
to mate is very Argentinian, yes.

318
00:12:44,338 --> 00:12:48,292
COBRA: Okay... So Dulce leche, where is it from, Rafa?

319
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:51,036
RAFA: Dulce de leche is Uruguayan, there is no discussion.

320
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:54,548
It's like Gardel, There's no doubt about that.

321
00:12:54,548 --> 00:12:58,549
COBRA: Did you know, Leo, that I played recently?
a game at Inter Miami and they kicked me?

322
00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:02,600
MESSI: Where? when you come here?

323
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,666
COBRA: Yes, when I went to see you...

324
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,480
We played a game of content creators

325
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,049
at Inter Miami and they kicked me out

326
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:11,480
I mean, in the semi-finals I scored two goals

327
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,782
and in the final they kicked me out for hitting other player.

328
00:13:12,782 --> 00:13:15,000
MESSI: Oh but you played like a tournament?

329
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,602
COBRA: Yes, yes, yes.

330
00:13:16,602 --> 00:13:17,242
MESSI: Really?

331
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,000
COBRA: Yes, yes. They kicked me out. Wrong decision from the ref.

332
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,680
SUAREZ: But it was one of...?

333
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,371
Was it now in September?

334
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:30,560
COBRA: no, no... it was...

335
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,842
in the club world cup, nine

336
00:13:31,842 --> 00:13:34,411
DAVO: You can see the picture of him, all dressed like Inter Miami,

337
00:13:34,411 --> 00:13:36,000
and the referee sending him off

338
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,320
making the elbow gesture.

339
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,199
RAFA: Yes, I saw photos and it was wrong because

340
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,880
Someone said: "it looks like Peppa Pig" and i don't agree...

341
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,404
COBRA: No, that has nothing to do with it...

342
00:13:46,404 --> 00:13:47,498
MESSI: Eeey dude

343
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:50,000
RAFA: Because it's not good to talk about bodies...

344
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
COBRA: No, no, no. Oh ok. Well, but

345
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,027
Physical appearance doesn't matter here, playing football matters here...

346
00:13:55,027 --> 00:13:56,320
Everyone does what they can.

347
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,920
RAFA: Sure.

348
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,240
COBRA: That's why...

349
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,839
SUAREZ: Tell him, Cobra, tell Leo how you describe yourself

350
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,872
How yo characterized... you characterize yourself as a striker

351
00:14:04,872 --> 00:14:06,214
COBRA: Yes...

352
00:14:06,723 --> 00:14:10,186
Hey, hey, good hit... good first touch,

353
00:14:10,186 --> 00:14:12,162
good return, good feint,

354
00:14:12,162 --> 00:14:14,042
speed, explosive, fast,

355
00:14:14,042 --> 00:14:16,759
good definition, eh, I have a good free kick,

356
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:18,124
Honestly, I'm not going to lie to you. ,

357
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,959
Penalties i take charge, it depends which penalty.

358
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,125
And corner kick if they force me to shoot it. And good aerial game.

359
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,891
MESSI: How?... How come "i take charge depending on which penalty"?

360
00:14:26,757 --> 00:14:29,435
COBRA: Sure, I mean, if it's 5 to 0   I'll kick it.

361
00:14:29,594 --> 00:14:31,696
If it is a final I prefer someone else to kick it.

362
00:14:34,355 --> 00:14:36,160
I mean, it depends on the match

363
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,160
It depends on the match...

364
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,857
Okeey...

365
00:14:45,693 --> 00:14:48,839
MESSI: Did you lose in semifinals?

366
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:50,961
COBRA: No, no, we reached the final

367
00:14:50,961 --> 00:14:52,639
and we lost the final. There they sent me off and played

368
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,600
all matches with one less player.

369
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,394
No, really, I felt really bad.

370
00:14:56,394 --> 00:14:58,839
MESSI: So someone else coudn't play, you had to play with one less player?

371
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:00,120
COBRA: Sure, we were one player short.

372
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,079
I felt really bad afterwards because

373
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:02,240
They were all looking at me with a strange face,

374
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,800
"Hey, dude you screwed up" and well, nothing,

375
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,160
I felt bad, but... nothing

376
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,052
my head went away...

377
00:15:08,052 --> 00:15:10,279
SUAREZ: Do you have a team of streamers?

378
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:12,521
of players?

379
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:14,365
COBRA: There is an Argentine selection of streamers,

380
00:15:14,365 --> 00:15:15,524
correct. Hey...

381
00:15:15,524 --> 00:15:18,240
DAVO: But no, it wasn't that one he was sent off.

382
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,378
it was one organized by Inter Miami.

383
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:21,519
SUAREZ: No, no, no. Yes, I know, but now

384
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,160
are you in the streamers team?

385
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,680
DAVO: Oh. We are not. No...

386
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,108
COBRA: No, we aren't.

387
00:15:26,108 --> 00:15:29,309
SUAREZ: They didn't call you?
RAFA: They were not called.

388
00:15:29,605 --> 00:15:32,932
DAVO: They don't call us! Kidding. But...

389
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,920
There are very good players, there is a high level.

390
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,768
SUAREZ: Yes?

391
00:15:37,768 --> 00:15:39,720
COBRA: Yes, but now with Davo we are going to travel

392
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,240
to Spain to play a match

393
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,291
to play against Spain

394
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:50,480
SUAREZ: But with the Argentinian team?

395
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,759
COBRA: Latin American, Latin America against Spain

396
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:55,000
DAVO: It's Latin America against Spain at the Málaga stadium

397
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,240
its now, at the end of the month, and Cobra doesn't stop texting me,

398
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,759
I swear, once a day he writes to me

399
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:01,720
and he tells me, "Listen to me, Davito, if I run

400
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,160
and you have the ball, you have to give it to me,

401
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,839
I'll put it in," he tells me. Like this every two...

402
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,000
He writes to me once a day, like if...

403
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,440
I tell him, "We are only gonna play for 10 minutes,

404
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,319
We are both horrible." He tells me,

405
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:14,440
"If I run, just give it to me."

406
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,199
I give it to you. But what are you going to do?

407
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:20,360
COBRA: Well...

408
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:26,009
MESSI: What position do you play, Davo?
SUAREZ: He didn't listen...

409
00:16:26,627 --> 00:16:29,573
COBRA: What kind of player are you, Davito? Leo asked you.

410
00:16:30,818 --> 00:16:34,160
DAVO: And I'm more like you, Leo. I am a 10,

411
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,506
Just as I respect that the Cobra is nine,

412
00:16:36,506 --> 00:16:38,045
I like to play more like a 10 ,

413
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:40,140
I like to take charge of free kicks,

414
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,120
I also really like to have

415
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,964
always the ball with me, I don't like

416
00:16:44,154 --> 00:16:46,160
to lose it, I have it,

417
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,600
If i pass it a long pass has to be a precise one,

418
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,720
I like short passes, strikes,

419
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,639
I have good first touch, definition too.

420
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,747
MESSI: Riquelme style, Riquelme style, like your idol

421
00:16:55,747 --> 00:16:58,160
DAVO: Exactly. Yes

422
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,800
to control the game in my own time.

423
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,199
To have the ball and the game

424
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,639
It's going to be played the way I want. I'm not going to wait

425
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,532
Let others tell me how to play it.

426
00:17:04,532 --> 00:17:06,199
SUAREZ: AJAJAJA
DAVO: I'm more of that style myself.

427
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:07,931
MESSI: You control the game.

428
00:17:07,931 --> 00:17:10,520
DAVO: Yesss totally.

429
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,839
Yes, I am similar to Riquelme
SUAREZ: Listen so in a team...

430
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,633
You two get along well, you get along great.

431
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:17,644
If Cobra plays... if Cobra he's "the nine"

432
00:17:17,644 --> 00:17:20,624
and he plays like me, and you play like Leo...

433
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,439
COBRA: Yes...the thing is we play like that in Play Station,

434
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:27,072
not in real life

435
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,320
SUAREZ: Rafa, orginice a match,

436
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,600
orginice a match with this two

437
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,440
RAFA: You are making me mad!

438
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,520
We have to make a challenge.

439
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,080
We play, but whenever they want

440
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,919
because apart from what I saw, they are both sinister,

441
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:42,813
They are horrible...

442
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:46,240
SUAREZ: What?
RAFA: We have a commercial break...

443
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,480
SUAREZ: Ok.

444
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,039
RAFA: Perfect.

445
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:50,515
SUAREZ: We'll see you later. Give it a hug.

446
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,880
COBRA: Of course, that's what happens, friend.

447
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,240
I think and say, "What would have...

448
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,520
Sometimes don't you Davito  get up

449
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,000
and say, "What would have happened if

450
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,679
I dedicated myself to being a football player?

451
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,316
How far would you have gotten?" Don't you think?

452
00:18:01,316 --> 00:18:03,162
DAVO: Being honest?...

453
00:18:03,162 --> 00:18:06,692
COBRA: Yes...
DAVO: I think that i would be nominee... a Ballon d'Or nominee...

454
00:18:07,714 --> 00:18:08,559
COBRA: Really?

455
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,320
DAVO: I'm not telling you i would have won it.
COBRA: Stop. You or me?

456
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,559
DAVO: Me... I'm not telling you i've had won it because...

457
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,039
It's just the Messi era, we're talking about

458
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:19,811
another level, but in another era, i could have won it

459
00:18:21,594 --> 00:18:23,679
COBRA: And a golden boot? You think I could have won it?

460
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,000
Davito?

461
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,559
DAVO: Yes! you would have won it. The issue is that also,

462
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:29,840
it was the Messi  / Suárez era, difficult to with the golden boot.

463
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,810
Complicated.

464
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,679
COBRA: Well, but maybe one, I don't know,

465
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,633
I don't know.

466
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,041
RAFA: We have visitors!

467
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:47,880
COBRA: There is someone hidden there that we don't see.

468
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,919
RAFA: Dude... don't you have any more cell phones?

469
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,942
Do you have only one cell phone? so you dont look cramped

470
00:18:54,209 --> 00:18:55,280
in just one frame

471
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,960
SUAREZ: What thing?

472
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,600
Why?

473
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,919
RAFA: No, because if you put more than one cell phone,

474
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:03,840
You'll look good. You look cramped there.

475
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,159
I can see two people and

476
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:09,000
a pink shirt there, I don't know.

477
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,840
SUAREZ: He's reading.

478
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,535
RAFA: Oh, he's a reader.

479
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,840
RAFA: "Diosito"!
DAVO: How are you doing Rodri?

480
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,210
COBRA: How you doing, Rodri? How are you?

481
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:22,501
DE PAUL: But dude, this started really early.

482
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,880
I just woke up...

483
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,559
COBRA: It's like that...

484
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,080
DE PAUL: Between Cobra and Davo...

485
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,711
I was just listening...

486
00:19:33,869 --> 00:19:36,240
Saying "We" "we"... it's your first game!

487
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,788
First time watching the team, idiots. What are saying?

488
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,840
DAVO: No! No!

489
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,720
DE PAUL: "We have to score more goals,"

490
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,418
"it works for us, we have to classify",

491
00:19:44,418 --> 00:19:47,132
"We"?

492
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,860
COBRA: Well, we're part of the team. Let's see,

493
00:19:51,051 --> 00:19:54,892
DAVO: We are here, you see, we are part of it, aren't we, Luis?

494
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,159
SUAREZ: Eeeh, yes. Well...

495
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:01,440
DE PAUL: Are these two reinforcements already?

496
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,526
Rafa is already in. I know he is...

497
00:20:02,526 --> 00:20:03,205
COBRA: Well...

498
00:20:03,205 --> 00:20:06,140
RAFA: They have to let up on the "reinforcements"!
* Uruguayan sandwich *

499
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:12,039
[Laughs]

500
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:14,720
DE PAUL: Are you physically ok? can you...

501
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,440
Are you up for playing a little bit?...

502
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,956
DAVO: I'm in

503
00:20:17,956 --> 00:20:19,760
RAFA: Cobra says he's in

504
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,298
DAVO: I support like 15 minutes.

505
00:20:22,298 --> 00:20:24,039
DE PAUL: You won a prize yesterday, didn't you, Davo?

506
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:26,245
Congratulations.

507
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,559
DAVO: Yes, yes.

508
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:31,320
DE PAUL: You won a prize, right?

509
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,559
DAVO: Yesterday. Yesterday, a streamer award

510
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:34,440
in Idol Awards

511
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,764
DE PAUL: For what?

512
00:20:37,145 --> 00:20:41,019
DAVO: Coverage for best streamer i won...

513
00:20:41,337 --> 00:20:43,360
DE PAUL: You don't look so happy, dude.

514
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,640
MESSI: Yes, he's saying it like "yeah meh".

515
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,160
[Laughs]

516
00:20:50,162 --> 00:20:51,280
RAFA: He's still half awake.

517
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,569
COBRA: It's okay if you smile, friend.

518
00:20:52,569 --> 00:20:54,280
RAFA: He don't even... He don't even knows if he is happy or sad

519
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,000
He is still groggy. He doesn't even know where he is right now.

520
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,320
It's the first time he is streaming at 10 in the morning

521
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,960
DE PAUL: You don't care at all!

522
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,720
DAVO: No, no! I swear It's not like that .

523
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,600
The thing is,it makes me a little embarrassed

524
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,440
I guess.

525
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:05,960
eh...

526
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,440
DE PAUL: You shoudn't, we saw you

527
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,000
DAVO: Yes you are right...

528
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,049
MESSI: And you, Cobra, you didn't win anything?

529
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:14,861
COBRA: No, no, they didn't even nominate me to say hello,

530
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:16,159
but well, unfortunately

531
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,186
You have to keep working. It's like that.

532
00:21:18,186 --> 00:21:21,140
MESSI: What happened, you weren't even nominated?

533
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:25,807
COBRA: No, no, literally I was not nominated for anything
but I was chill, it doesn't matter

535
00:21:28,764 --> 00:21:34,200
DE PAUL: They're shutting you down, Cobra.

536
00:21:34,714 --> 00:21:36,760
COBRA: It's difficult, it's difficult, but

537
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,320
It was not my time, it was not my time. But the thing

538
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,720
that hurt me the most is that generally

539
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,679
in those

540
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:42,240
In those events what hurts me is that

541
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,640
generally there is good food catering

542
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,840
And I wanted to go to eat something,

543
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,799
but not even that, so it was complicated

544
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:50,520
DE PAUL: No way...
MESSI: But not even a nomination?

545
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,626
Dude

546
00:21:51,626 --> 00:21:52,545
DE PAUL: Not even nominated?

547
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:54,159
COBRA: Hey, life is hard

548
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,395
RAFA: They're blaming you a little, it seems to me Cobra.

549
00:21:57,395 --> 00:21:59,520
COBRA: No, no, it's ok. No problem,

550
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,840
no problem. It's like that.

551
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,320
DAVO: No, no. For me, it was wrong.

552
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,120
In fact, I told the event organizer,

553
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,960
Not having Cobra ...

554
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,520
It was a shame, and they said "yes, but hey, thing are like that..."

555
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,880
DE PAUL: Yes, yes, "I told them, I told them"

556
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,440
and when you were up there

557
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,720
when you received the award, that's when you had to say it stupid!

558
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,474
Don't believe him Cobra !

559
00:22:15,474 --> 00:22:17,312
DAVO: I regretted it Cobrita, sorry
DE PAUL: He didn't put his heart out for you!

560
00:22:17,312 --> 00:22:19,919
DAVO: Sorry Cobrita, sorry. What do you want?

561
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,880
I had my mom there crying and you spect me to say:

562
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,960
"Cobra should to be here"?

563
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,120
Let Cobra suck my balls. Thats it.

564
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,447
COBRA: No! stop it!

565
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:31,080
It's okay, it's okay. Davo, you'll see...

566
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,120
when you say I need a video for YouTube...

567
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,440
I'm going to tell you "I can't friend, I can't"

568
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,476
RAFA: Question for everyone except Davo...

569
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:38,320
Isn't it stupid?...

570
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,760
"Yes, this is for Mile who is my love,

571
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,125
who is always there for me... who accompanies me"

572
00:22:44,411 --> 00:22:48,930
instead of friends, who are always there.
MESSI: Nah, it's okay dude...

573
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:51,120
MESSI: We just saw the speech, for me it was good

574
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,120
RAFA: You are a henpecked husband too, you and Luis...

575
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,640
Well...you can't talk

576
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,559
Of course

577
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:59,320
COBRA: no, but it's ok, nothing happens.

578
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,520
It's like that, Rafa, when I have to upload some

579
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,360
video he' will have to ask Mile to make it

580
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,960
RAFA: Sure.

581
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,960
COBRA: It's okay.

582
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,080
SUAREZ: But he also thanked his mother
RAFA: In three months she realizes, she leaves him,

583
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,720
She dumps him, she dumps him...

584
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,279
DAVO: Stop, stop, I have to interrupt you there, howcome

585
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:19,120
"she leaves him""? what do you mean by that?

586
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,159
RAFA: Sure, sooner or later he will leave you

587
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,440
RAFA: sooner or later she's going to leave you, and you're going to go crying with

588
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,679
Cobra, which will receive you half naked

589
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:30,760
with two boxes of pizza and he's going to tell you "come here friend"

590
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,799
Is allright...

591
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,559
DE PAUL: but it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter what's going to happen!

592
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:35,159
he felt it, you have to do what

593
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:36,799
you feels...

594
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,799
no matter what comes!

595
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,679
DAVO: Listen to the ones who know, Rafa, so much so that

596
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:42,679
you talk, listen the ones who know. Apart from that its true

597
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:44,080
she support me every day, how can I not recognize her?

598
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,720
DE PAUL: You only never felt grateful for ...

599
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,240
You never felt grateful for Cobra, because you didn't say it,

600
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,200
but you felt the other thing.

601
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,400
DAVO: Exactly. I thought about Cobra,

602
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,419
but I don't know, it didn't come out.

603
00:23:56,051 --> 00:23:58,005
After the awards...

604
00:23:58,005 --> 00:24:03,080
we went partying after the awards... here Cobrix...

605
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:06,614
COBRA: Nono, I didn't go out. I went to take care of you,

606
00:24:06,614 --> 00:24:09,000
I went to take care of you, it's different.

607
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,279
RAFA: And you stayed up all night?

608
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,654
COBRA: And, sadly yes. But it's okey.

609
00:24:16,654 --> 00:24:21,840
MESSI: Oh! well but you look good...

610
00:24:22,187 --> 00:24:25,312
COBRA: Working hard Leo, working as always
SUAREZ: You're looking forward to the match to end, right?

611
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:27,871
NO PAUL: You don't know if you're with the green players or the white ones, right?

612
00:24:27,871 --> 00:24:31,122
The ones that have to win...

613
00:24:33,882 --> 00:24:35,880
You just shout the goals

614
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,000
DAVO: Enjoying youth...

615
00:24:39,637 --> 00:24:41,360
COBRA: Well...

616
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,074
NO PAUL: Cobra is the one that uses

617
00:24:43,074 --> 00:24:44,320
three thermoses when drinkin mate?

618
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,360
MESSI: Yes, Cobra

619
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,316
SUAREZ: "Nine", "el nine"

620
00:24:47,316 --> 00:24:48,891
He likes to be called "el nine"

621
00:24:48,891 --> 00:24:50,399
DAVO: No Luchito don't! Luchito no... "Cobra" it's fine

622
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:52,480
COBRA: Thank you, thank you Luis.

623
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,279
How did you call me Rodri? I didn't hear well Rodri...How did you call me?

624
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:56,667
FROM PAUL: Nine, ¿nine?

625
00:24:56,667 --> 00:25:00,520
COBRA: Yes, yes, yes. Rodri, I hear you

626
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,467
DE PAUL: Three thermoses not changing the herbs?

627
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:05,088
MESSI: Davo doesn't drink mate, Davo doesn't like it.

628
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:07,320
COBRA: Of course,  I already know that

629
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,388
It's a little watery, but that's it

630
00:25:08,388 --> 00:25:11,279
I can't replace the herbs, you see? I have to go down,

631
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,425
change it... in the middle of the stream...

632
00:25:13,425 --> 00:25:15,200
it gets complicated

633
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,880
DE PAUL: But you handle it well, let's say.

634
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,860
COBRA: I 'm okay . I 'm okay with that.

635
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,708
I try to handle it . Yes, yes, yes.

636
00:25:21,867 --> 00:25:24,440
DE PAUL: And Davito no  mate at all?

637
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,658
DAVO: No, no, I'm not used to drink mate, I don't have the habit.

638
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,080
I am more of a water person

639
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,880
as it comes.

640
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,960
DE PAUL: No, here th "mate"... here making "mate"

641
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,240
What can i say, it depends on the day,

642
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,279
the humor, like you see

643
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,880
DAVO: But you drink every day don't you?

644
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,305
DE PAUL: These two are gettin old, you know?

645
00:25:39,305 --> 00:25:42,720
It's not easy for me, with the years

646
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,000
you have less patience.

647
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,042
RAFA: They get crafty, don't they, Rodri?

648
00:25:46,042 --> 00:25:49,219
DE PAUL: That's the word, they both get crafty...

649
00:25:49,219 --> 00:25:54,480
getting closer to 40... they're close to 40 already

650
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:56,360
DAVO: Listen Rodri, I have to tell you something.

651
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,120
In yesterday's awards, "pollo" Alvarez

652
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,240
won an award for best... viral clip

653
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,166
of the year, and its your clip,

654
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:04,840
where you rate your clothes.

655
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,080
COBRA: Correct.

656
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,419
DE PAUL: If its not for me "pollo" can't win anything Davo .
It has to be something like that...

657
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:16,000
DAVO: He thanked you, there were literally 800 clips and won:
"De Paul with "pollo" Alvarez clip"

658
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,840
winning prize"

659
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,161
DE PAUL: How strange, I didn't even know that.

660
00:26:22,161 --> 00:26:26,889
DAVO: They should have told you...
DE PAUL: But you don't get money, you only win the prize, don't you?

661
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:29,674
DAVO: It's the prize. It's just the prize...

662
00:26:29,674 --> 00:26:31,914
DE PAUL: Let "pollo" keep it then...

663
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,460
RAFA: And Cobra wich one won?

664
00:26:35,288 --> 00:26:38,844
DAVO: Eh...No, they didn't nominate him.
DE PAUL: "Making "mates"...

665
00:26:38,844 --> 00:26:41,640
"the one who lasts the longest with the same herbs" of the year
COBRA: Motivational speech

666
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,866
SUAREZ: The one who uses the most water...

667
00:26:44,866 --> 00:26:47,640
COBRA: No... Well, it's difficult. Well, but let's see,

668
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,960
I ask you a question, Luis.

669
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,520
I have a question, Luis.

670
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,418
MESSI: But... Have you ever won Cobra or not?

671
00:26:51,418 --> 00:26:52,399
Its not the first year that they give them...

672
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:55,039
COBRA: Yes, last year... last year I won

673
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:55,997
not the same awards,

674
00:26:55,997 --> 00:26:58,200
but I did win other prizes.

675
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,411
DE PAUL: You won the love of the people, Cobrita!
That's what's worth the most

676
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,404
COBRA: Lets go, Rodri.

677
00:27:02,404 --> 00:27:06,480
DAVO: Thats right! The streets don't forget Cobrita!

678
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,459
COBRA: Lets go, Rodri. I mean...

679
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,559
I don't want to compare myself, but for example Suárez

680
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:11,600
He was not always nominated for the Ballon d'Or, for example.

681
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,720
DAVO: No, no, no...

682
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,080
DE PAUL: Well, but you're comparing yourself. You say

683
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,399
"I don't want to compare myself" but you are comparing yourself.

684
00:27:17,399 --> 00:27:18,360
COBRA: Well, well, I mean, I want to talk

685
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,186
a bit of football history,

686
00:27:19,186 --> 00:27:21,520
That's what I mean, you understand? For example...

687
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,720
and it's not that strange.

688
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,440
DE PAUL: And he (Messi) didn't win nine Ballon d'Or either,

689
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,604
so...

690
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:28,241
COBRA: Sure, i guess. Well...

691
00:27:28,241 --> 00:27:30,000
DE PAUL: He didn't win nine Ballon d'Or, it's the same.

692
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,795
DAVO: Okay but anyway, stop, let's not underestimate ourselves...

693
00:27:31,795 --> 00:27:33,459
In this call there are eight Ballon d'Ors.

694
00:27:33,459 --> 00:27:35,914
Why throw us down

695
00:27:35,914 --> 00:27:36,765
among us?

696
00:27:36,765 --> 00:27:39,618
RAFA: Just stay you three
And there are still eight.

697
00:27:41,043 --> 00:27:44,009
DAVO: No no, Cobrita has one too back there

698
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:46,946
COBRA: Sure, it's true. I have it back there

699
00:27:46,946 --> 00:27:50,227
DE PAUL: Stop... is there an award? for...

700
00:27:50,227 --> 00:27:51,591
for streaming,

701
00:27:51,591 --> 00:27:55,757
similar to Ballon d'Or in football. Are there any?

702
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,585
COBRA: Theoretically it is this...

703
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:01,240
DAVO: The streamer of the year award

704
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,480
RAFA: Oh, look how he is dressed...

705
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,120
DE PAUL: Streamer of the year?

706
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,457
DAVO: Exactly.

707
00:28:06,457 --> 00:28:07,279
DE PAUL: Is that it?

708
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,279
DAVO: Its that...

709
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:13,009
COBRA: No, not if you're laughing at me, ok?
Don't laugh, Rodri because I'm leaving.

710
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:14,644
You are disrespecting my work.

711
00:28:14,644 --> 00:28:17,895
DE PAUL: Are you crazy? I mean...

712
00:28:17,895 --> 00:28:21,277
SUAREZ: A cucumber? What is it? a leek?

713
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:28,440
COBRA: No, no, you're laughing!

714
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:32,895
No, I feel bad, I feel bad.

715
00:28:33,499 --> 00:28:36,000
DE PAUL: I seriously ask, which one is that?

716
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,200
the streamer of the year?

717
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,159
DAVO: Yes, yes, the streamer of the year.

718
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,679
COBRA: Yes. Something like that

719
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,018
DAVO: Cobra won the last... The last edition

720
00:28:41,018 --> 00:28:43,840
The one he has its the real one. And every year it is returned

721
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,686
COBRA: And Davo won it last month.

722
00:28:46,686 --> 00:28:48,181
Davo won it last month.

723
00:28:48,181 --> 00:28:51,799
DAVO: No idiot, last year...
COBRA: It's like when, for example,
Modric gave the golden ball to Leo.

724
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:53,285
Yes, that's what I say, the last prize.

725
00:28:53,285 --> 00:28:54,799
It's like when Modric gave the

726
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:55,960
golden ball to Leo...

727
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,867
So, it's the same. It's the same.

728
00:28:57,867 --> 00:29:02,129
DAVO: Because that is the original award,
once a year it changes.

729
00:29:02,129 --> 00:29:04,004
DE PAUL: And you both won it?

730
00:29:04,004 --> 00:29:06,279
Davo this year and Cobra last year?

731
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:08,365
Davo: No, no. Me in 2023 and him in 2024.

732
00:29:08,365 --> 00:29:10,640
Me first, Rodri.

733
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,519
DE PAUL: Ok...

734
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:14,711
COBRA: Hey, what's wrong with you? Enlarged

735
00:29:14,997 --> 00:29:19,824
DE PAUL: This guy is an idiot Cobra, he's a pisser, he's a pisser.

736
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,499
MESSI: And this year, when do they do them?

737
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,120
COBRA: like... we don't know. I imagine that

738
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,040
in December

739
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,077
We hope in December.

740
00:29:29,618 --> 00:29:31,760
COBRA: But if they dont continue
I'll keep it Leo, what do you think?

741
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,200
DAVO: The Martín Fierro awards are also in December

742
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,194
that we are both going.

743
00:29:35,194 --> 00:29:35,993
COBRA: Sure.

744
00:29:35,993 --> 00:29:38,330
DE PAUL: Yes. Martín Fierro there was a lot of drama,

745
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:40,211
A lot of controversy.

746
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:43,629
DAVO: Yes! Now the digital awards are coming...

747
00:29:43,629 --> 00:29:45,668
DE PAUL: You see? We are aware of everything

748
00:29:46,177 --> 00:29:49,188
DAVO: How do you say I should be dressed? Rodri?
to the Martín Fierro awards...

749
00:29:49,188 --> 00:29:51,350
Suit? Or do I play it a little more?

750
00:29:51,573 --> 00:29:53,403
RAFA: Cover yourself as much as you can!

751
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:56,181
[Laughs]

752
00:29:56,181 --> 00:29:58,460
DE PAUL: Stop Rafa!...

753
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,170
December, lets see, is summer,

754
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:05,841
you can be a little risky...

755
00:30:05,841 --> 00:30:08,005
For me you can play a little risky,

756
00:30:08,005 --> 00:30:10,964
for me to say something,

757
00:30:10,964 --> 00:30:13,186
do you remember... Do you remember how he went

758
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,425
with a controversial outfit, to a golden ball gala?

759
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:16,987
SUAREZ: The embroidery suit?
RAFA: The one with the polka dots?

760
00:30:16,987 --> 00:30:18,440
MESSI: I had several, I had a couple

761
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,201
I had a couple.

762
00:30:19,201 --> 00:30:21,002
DE PAUL: For me something like that, you have to wear something like that.

763
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,760
There was a burgundy suit, one with dots

764
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,760
MESSI: No, that's the black one...

765
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,178
RAFA: The one with the polka dots. The one with the polka dots was tremendous.

766
00:30:28,178 --> 00:30:29,440
He looked like a rug

767
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,561
MESSI: I don't know, I had four years in a row that...

768
00:30:32,561 --> 00:30:34,640
that I wear different ones.

769
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,520
COBRA: For me the one from 2013/2014, that's crazy.

770
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,814
RAFA: Was it a bet that you had lost or something like that?

771
00:30:38,814 --> 00:30:41,889
MESSI: Which one was that? What was the 2014 one ?

772
00:30:41,889 --> 00:30:43,840
COBRA: It was the one that... it was one that you used, Leo.

773
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,307
embroidered, that when you're on the shortlist

774
00:30:45,307 --> 00:30:46,443
with Cristiano and with Robben,

775
00:30:46,443 --> 00:30:48,322
The three of them together, do you remember?

776
00:30:48,322 --> 00:30:49,922
That one was awesome.

777
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,226
MESSI: Good.
COBRA: That one was nice... and I

778
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:53,529
When I won last year's award,

779
00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:55,600
I wanted to buy one like that, but it didn't fit.

780
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,880
I mean, I looked for one like that, but when I went

781
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,635
to the store it didn't fit. So, well

782
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,639
nothing, i looked for another.

783
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:03,538
DE PAUL: And for example the first one when he was nominated,

784
00:31:03,538 --> 00:31:05,227
how badly he was dressed,

785
00:31:05,227 --> 00:31:06,919
I think it was 2007.

786
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:07,799
MESSI: Who?

787
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,733
DE PAUL: You came third, right?

788
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:11,774
Put that one in, you'll see.

789
00:31:12,314 --> 00:31:14,914
RAFA: Horrible...

790
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,960
COBRA: Nah it was good. Compliant, compliant.

791
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,080
DE PAUL: You were wearing Adidas, idiot.

792
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,120
You were all Adidas, man.

793
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,148
MESSI: No, I was always fine.

794
00:31:21,148 --> 00:31:23,600
The hair style maybe i changed...

795
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,720
but the suit was good...

796
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,960
COBRA: The hair, the beard.

797
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,351
RAFA: No, no. The one from 2007 is a disaster.

798
00:31:28,351 --> 00:31:31,399
And Cobra...if you ...
MESSI: He looked for it, look, this motherfucker looked for it

799
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:34,398
DE PAUL: Search the photo, search for the photo and show it there!

800
00:31:34,906 --> 00:31:37,240
He is wearing an Adidas outfit !
MESSI: How an Adidas outfit?

801
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,138
DAVO: It's the most normal thing in the world!

802
00:31:39,138 --> 00:31:41,658
It's a jacket with a tie and a shirt.

803
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:42,858
MESSI: Sure.

804
00:31:42,858 --> 00:31:44,788
RAFA: No, no, no.

805
00:31:44,788 --> 00:31:46,188
There is a previous one is a disaster,

806
00:31:46,188 --> 00:31:48,011
It is unpresentable.

807
00:31:48,011 --> 00:31:51,291
The one with glitter, like Messi's, you have to wear...

808
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:53,179
COBRA: Don't be bad Rafa.

809
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,750
MESSI: But you have to sunbathe a little for december, dude

810
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,441
to wear something different.

811
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,880
A little bit burned...

812
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,639
DE PAUL: Yes, you are pale, Davo. We are not kidding.

813
00:32:10,476 --> 00:32:13,476
SUAREZ: It reminded me of Rafa number 3...

814
00:32:13,476 --> 00:32:15,600
DE PAUL: Come on, idiot!
RAFA: Well...

815
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,612
DE PAUL: 20 minutes, not even that much!

816
00:32:19,612 --> 00:32:21,452
DAVO: I should, i should, i should

817
00:32:21,801 --> 00:32:23,579
DE PAUL: A little bit of vitamin D.

818
00:32:24,366 --> 00:32:25,740
COBRA: But think that we

819
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,748
We wake up at 4 in the afternoon

820
00:32:26,748 --> 00:32:28,316
Dude, we get up at 4 in the afternoon

821
00:32:28,316 --> 00:32:29,613
and go to sleep at 3 am,

822
00:32:29,613 --> 00:32:30,706
later, 6 in the morning

823
00:32:30,706 --> 00:32:32,799
DAVO: The streamer's life is very difficult

824
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,080
COBRA: It's not easy. It's not easy.

825
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,561
DE PAUL: And what are the schedules like?

826
00:32:37,561 --> 00:32:38,952
You get up at 4pm and then what?

827
00:32:38,952 --> 00:32:41,113
You have lunch?

828
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:44,281
COBRA: Of course it's lunch time.
DAVO: No, I have dinner after streaming

829
00:32:44,281 --> 00:32:45,734
DAVO: I have dinner around 6 in the morning,

830
00:32:45,734 --> 00:32:47,614
I end stream and i eat.

831
00:32:47,771 --> 00:32:50,170
DE PAUL: Dinner is at 6 am?

832
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:52,618
DAVO: Kinda, yes.

833
00:32:52,618 --> 00:32:54,880
COBRA: Always healthy.

834
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,594
DE PAUL: Ok, thats ok.

835
00:32:56,594 --> 00:32:58,987
RAFA: For example?
DE PAUL: And lunch is at 5 in the afternoon...

836
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:01,452
DAVO: Sometimes I skip lunch

837
00:33:01,452 --> 00:33:04,972
to start stream with a light body.

838
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,080
COBRA: I don't skip it. I never skip it.

839
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,773
Because its essential to be nourished.

840
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,559
No, I don't skip it. I don't skip it

841
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:14,644
Because it couald be bad for me.

842
00:33:14,644 --> 00:33:16,378
It could be bad, just in case.

843
00:33:16,378 --> 00:33:18,494
It's a lot of wear and tear. Streaming is a lot of wear and tear.

844
00:33:18,494 --> 00:33:19,494
You know what i'm saying?

845
00:33:19,494 --> 00:33:20,621
Has it never happened to you in a match?

846
00:33:20,621 --> 00:33:22,007
When you feel like you played badly

847
00:33:22,007 --> 00:33:22,859
Because you were missing something?

848
00:33:23,113 --> 00:33:25,519
That happens to me on the stream. If one day I have a bad stream,

849
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,845
I feel like it's because I lacked a little food

850
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,286
Because I could miss something...

851
00:33:30,969 --> 00:33:34,046
DE PAUL: And on the stream? You always stream

852
00:33:34,046 --> 00:33:36,043
like two or three hours. Always sitting down?....

853
00:33:36,043 --> 00:33:39,798
DAVO: No! I stream like 7 - 8 hours! from 9 at night to 5 am.

854
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,799
DE PAUL: Don't you ever get bored?

855
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,799
DAVO: Y...
DE PAUL: You have to, i think you lose your mind

856
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,478
DAVO: Nah, as long as they pay good, as long as they pay,

857
00:33:48,478 --> 00:33:50,078
no problem.

858
00:33:50,078 --> 00:33:53,039
COBRA: This question is for Leo, Rodri and Luis...

859
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:56,002
By any chance, if I say "imposter", do you know what that is?

860
00:33:56,002 --> 00:33:57,993
*The IMPOSTOR is a game made popular by La Cobra and Davo*

861
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:00,441
DE PAUL and SUAREZ: Yeees!

862
00:34:00,441 --> 00:34:02,240
COBRA: Really??

863
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,608
DE PAUL: And how can we not know?

864
00:34:04,608 --> 00:34:06,208
COBRA: Ah! very good, very good.

865
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,255
SUAREZ. Ah, the kids, the kids...
DE PAUL: Look, you don't know...

866
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:10,281
MESSI: Yes, stupid if I play with my kids.

867
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:13,347
SUAREZ: Of course, the kids play with him. They got it from you...
COBRA: Seriously!?

868
00:34:13,347 --> 00:34:16,369
DAVO: Stop, stop, are you playing impostor with your children?

869
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,361
MESSI: Yes, dude.

870
00:34:17,361 --> 00:34:21,334
DE PAUL: You know which one we play
when we are bored with the dwarf (Messi)?

871
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,444
DAVO: Which one?
DE PAUL: " I can tell you? Three players..."

872
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,755
DAVO: Oh, "liar, liar"!

873
00:34:28,755 --> 00:34:29,377
COBRA: Yes...

874
00:34:29,377 --> 00:34:31,067
DE PAUL: "that played..." That one

875
00:34:31,307 --> 00:34:34,560
MESSI: This guy sucks at it
COBRA: With Davo we have literally 20 uploaded

876
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,205
videos to YouTube of it, because we have no more ideas.

877
00:34:36,205 --> 00:34:38,099
"I can tell you seven players from Zambia"

878
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:38,599
because we no longer have

879
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:40,320
any more ideas. We have been

880
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,851
stealing for two years with that...

881
00:34:41,851 --> 00:34:45,371
DAVO: Match is over. 6 - 0 Deportivo LSM.

882
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,520
We won!

883
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,079
SUAREZ: Close Rafa...

884
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:51,440
RAFA: Lets go!

885
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,220
Lets go

886
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,546
DE PAUL: 6-0 dude.

887
00:34:55,546 --> 00:34:58,726
COBRA: All ours right Davo? Aura of streamers.

888
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,424
DE PAUL: But 6-0 away...

889
00:35:02,424 --> 00:35:04,220
Did the players from Montevideo went partying with you

890
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,312
yesterday after the awards?

891
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:10,892
[Laughs]

892
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,764
DE PAUL: Away team scores six goals?

893
00:35:13,764 --> 00:35:18,603
either the team is very good or Deportivo is...

894
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,630
eh?

895
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:23,387
DAVO: Its because we are here!
COBRA: But Davo, Boca lost the match

896
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:25,547
Aren't you going to say anything? You have to defend us.

897
00:35:25,801 --> 00:35:27,680
DAVO: No, but it is Montevideo Boca Juniors. Stop stupid...

898
00:35:29,313 --> 00:35:30,079
COBRA: Ah, ah...

899
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,119
SUAREZ: Listen... Well,

900
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,200
I wanted to thank you

901
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,426
to both of you and Rafa.

902
00:35:37,744 --> 00:35:38,894
COBRA: No, please, my pleasure, thank you very much guys.

903
00:35:38,894 --> 00:35:41,347
SUAREZ: Thank you very much for the good vibes.

904
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,760
Thanks to Rodri who just woke up too

905
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,555
and Leo and thats it I think

906
00:35:49,555 --> 00:35:52,157
I think we had a good time and... nothing more

907
00:35:52,157 --> 00:35:53,677
I don't know what to do now. I don't know, Rafa,

908
00:35:53,677 --> 00:35:54,654
you are used to this,

909
00:35:54,654 --> 00:35:57,654
what needs to be done now? We end it thats it?

910
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,000
RAFA: Yes, now we close the transmission,

911
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,800
thank you basically

912
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,599
to the stars of this transmission

913
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:08,686
Davo and Cobra, who are awesome

914
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,880
...who made a very big effort.

915
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,041
SUAREZ: "nine" and "the leek"

916
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,480
MESSI: Are you going to sleep now or are you staying...?

917
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,515
RAFA: ...the Nine and the leek

918
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,095
DAVO: Naaa, I'm leaving now...

919
00:36:16,819 --> 00:36:19,548
DAVO: Now I watch the first half of Manchester game and I'm going to sleep
RAFA: He's sleeping until 7 pm, Leo

920
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,880
He will sleep until 7 pm.

921
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,480
DAVO: No, tomorrow I have to go out .

922
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,062
Tomorrow I have to go out again.

923
00:36:24,062 --> 00:36:27,261
I have to be fine for the night today.

924
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:28,868
RAFA: Wow it's incredible

925
00:36:28,868 --> 00:36:30,789
COBRA: Now I'm going to work ...

926
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,880
Now I'm going to work to the construction site

927
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,400
and this continues. This goes on long.

928
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,452
SUAREZ: What work? What work?

929
00:36:36,452 --> 00:36:38,771
COBRA: I'm doing some things at home and I'm working.

930
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:41,319
SUAREZ: Look... on a Saturday

931
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:43,280
RAFA: No, he doesn't even get up from the chair.

932
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,808
He doesn't even get up from the chair. He doesn't even get up to pee

933
00:36:45,808 --> 00:36:48,160
COBRA: Oh, shut up Rafa, you just asked...

934
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,668
you were lost...

935
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:53,711
No, really guys, thanks.
DE PAUL: Root for us tonight, boys.

936
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:58,401
RAFA: To Luis, Leo and "Diosito"

937
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,609
that joined the stream too

938
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:02,027
a big hug

939
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,751
that we always watched him

940
00:37:04,751 --> 00:37:06,715
in the Marginal and the truth...

941
00:37:06,715 --> 00:37:08,292
It was very good.

942
00:37:09,467 --> 00:37:11,162
DAVO: Well, the one that scored against us the other day,

943
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:13,438
Barracas' goal looks like you, don't you think?

944
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,119
DAVO: Insúa

945
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,119
COBRA: Insúa

946
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:17,881
DE PAUL: The one with the braids...

947
00:37:17,881 --> 00:37:19,640
So, are you watching the Inter Miami game tonight?

948
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,200
or are you streaming? ...

949
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,640
RAFA: Cerro is playing tonight, Rodri, if not ... In a good way...

950
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,599
COBRA: Inter Miami - Nashville

951
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,000
DAVO: We will watch it

952
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,172
SUAREZ: Stop, explain what Cerro is

953
00:37:31,172 --> 00:37:34,049
because Rodri doesn't know what Cerro is, idiot

954
00:37:34,049 --> 00:37:36,680
RAFA: But if you don't know, you have no idea about football.

955
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,079
Cerro is the biggest team in Uruguay.

956
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:42,079
They just beatted Peñarol, today they are going to beat Nacional

957
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,633
SUAREZ: It's like Chacarita from Argentina.

958
00:37:44,633 --> 00:37:46,027
DAVO: No! Weaker than Chacarita...

959
00:37:46,789 --> 00:37:48,149
RAFA: The greatest...

960
00:37:48,149 --> 00:37:50,000
The biggest club, like Central... (Newell's rival team, Messi's former club)

961
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,949
It's seriously big, like Central.

962
00:37:56,619 --> 00:37:59,299
Look how he raised his head.

963
00:37:59,458 --> 00:38:01,137
SUAREZ: Well, people...

964
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:01,920
COBRA: Thank you.

965
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,960
SUAREZ: Thank you. I send you a big hug

966
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,260
COBRA: Take care, see you later
DE PAUL: Bye band!

967
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:11,020
RAFA: Close there.
COBRA: Bye bye!
