1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,880
I always say that football is...

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,680
I’ve seen everything in football.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,560
I don’t think I’ve ever seen a ten minutes like that.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,240
My name is Eli Mengem and for the past few years

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,480
I’ve been traversing Europe

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,560
documenting the tales of football clubs and their fanbases

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,160
who’ve been on the verge of winning something

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,840
for the first time in a long time.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,800
If not ever.

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,840
From Northern Turkey

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,880
to Southern Spain.

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,120
From South West Germany to the

13
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,360
Basque country.

14
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,920
I’ve been on a mission to show how important it is

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,240
that the game has a variety of winners

16
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,040
So that we learn about new places.

17
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,840
New people.

18
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,720
New cultures.

19
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,600
And most importantly, new stories.

20
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,280
Then came the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

21
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,840
Where I knew the exact “Once In A Lifetime” story I had to tell.

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,960
So as the world’s media descended on Qatar

23
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,920
to be at the tournament.

24
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,840
COPA90 and I decided to fly 8000 miles in the opposite direction

25
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,600
to tell the ultimate story of a football fanbase

26
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,040
on the brink of ending a 36 year wait

27
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,600
for the biggest prize in sport.

28
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,560
But what we found we found was a story that transcended football.

29
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,960
A story that reached into the very soul of a nation

30
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,560
that laid itself bare over two fateful weeks.

31
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,880
A story that etched a struggle for identity in a search for glory

32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,840
that began over two centuries ago

33
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,560
A story about Lionel Messi.

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,480
Argentina.

35
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,120
And 45 million people yearning to reclaim their place in history.

36
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,920
This is the all angle, on the ground, as it happened,

37
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,800
ultimate account of perhaps the greatest football story of our time.

38
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,960
- Yo Eli what’s going on man, where are we at?

39
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,320
We are in Argentina.

40
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,320
A very hot, a very sweaty Argentina

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,400
during their first ever summertime World Cup

42
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,240
and I’m excited.

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,360
There’s only a couple of hours before...

44
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,840
the big Quarter-Final against the Dutch.

45
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,880
We don’t actually have too much to do before we have to be

46
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,920
in what is expected to be a sold out fanzone.

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,160
So first things first we need to find my fixer, Val.

48
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,920
and then just before the fanzone

49
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,520
I’m going to catch up with a journalist friend of mine, Santi.

50
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,920
Who I think is the perfect person

51
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,200
to give me an understanding of

52
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,120
how big of a deal

53
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,520
what’s going on here is

54
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,000
and just what we’re in store for.

55
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,920
Now tell me, first and foremost

56
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,680
we could have picked any country to go to

57
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,680
to cover this World Cup.

58
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,920
We put all our budget on this one.

59
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,360
Why do you think we did it? And was it a good idea?

60
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,040
Yes it was a great idea for you to come to Argentina.

61
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,000
Because, I mean, these people are longing

62
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,880
for something to be cheerful about.

63
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,800
This World Cup is like a boiling point...

64
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,160
for this national team.

65
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,680
Because, the World Cup is an obsession for Argentines.

66
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,120
It’s already 36 years

67
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,760
that’s how long we’ve been waiting for someone, anyone

68
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,320
to make us lift that trophy again.

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,600
35’ GOAL ARGENTINA! Molina

70
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,000
It is now or never.

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,560
It is right at this moment.

72
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,640
1-0

73
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,920
To finally, finally...

74
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,120
get the chance to win the trophy.

75
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,680
1 -0 up at the break and with a foot in the Semi-Final

76
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,600
the emotional climate of the fanzone

77
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,520
was a collective, confident ecstasy.

78
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,400
Which was an even more notable achievement

79
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,480
given the actual climate.

80
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,840
You see with this World Cup being the first ever

81
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,240
to be played in December.

82
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,960
It meant that Argentina were experiencing

83
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,200
their first international tournament in their summer.

84
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,320
And whilst that had helped create atmospheres and crowds

85
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,320
never quite seen during winter tournaments.

86
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,600
It also brought it’s own obstacles.

87
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,680
Yet as the second half approached

88
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,200
and the temperature went up another level

89
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,160
it was clear that no one was going anywhere...

90
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,680
In fact as the temperature went up

91
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,320
so did the atmosphere.

92
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,000
As Argentinians young and old defied their health

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,640
to show their support.

94
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,040
And then, deep into the second half

95
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,480
their efforts were rewarded.

96
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,400
73’ - PENALTY ARGENTINA

97
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,120
And so with only 15 minutes left

98
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,920
Argentina had a golden chance to double their lead

99
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,720
with a spot kick taken by...

100
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,160
Who else?

101
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,400
Messi who is heading into this World Cup

102
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,760
still at the top of his powers but at 35 years old

103
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,960
which could mean

104
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,920
this is the last shot he will ever have

105
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,920
of trying to win the trophy he has been looking for...

106
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,080
basically from the very first moment he put an Argentina shirt on.

107
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,000
2-0 up with a goal and an incredible assist from Messi

108
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,400
Argentina were on their way to the Semi-Finals of a World Cup

109
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,200
in fairytale fashion.

110
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,280
And so, swept up by the sun and the songs.

111
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,120
The jumping and the jubilation.

112
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,840
The hugs

113
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,960
and the kisses.

114
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,800
With only ten minutes left it truly felt like we had touched down

115
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,480
on the happiest place on earth.

116
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,480
However...

117
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,360
Little did we know what was to come.

118
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,040
Netherlands have scored.

119
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,400
It’s gone from elation to tension...

120
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:33,880
like that.

121
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,600
We got six minutes to hold on.

122
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:48,505
The Dutch just should have scored.

123
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,360
Even though they still had a 1 goal lead...

124
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,800
And with the referee adding 10 minutes of additional time

125
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,040
That climate of confident ecstasy had evaporated.

126
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,520
Argentina have given away a free kick

127
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,080
They’ve actually done it.

128
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,840
All of a sudden, the happiest place on earth

129
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,160
had become anything but.

130
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,600
And if you thought regular time was emotional...

131
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,840
Are we going to penalties.

132
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,120
2-0 up with ten minutes, but it's going down to penalties.

133
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,880
Ten clear chances in extra time.

134
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
But it's going to penalties.

135
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,600
It's 50/50 if Argentina will prevail.

136
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:13,360
It's 50/50 if the foothall gods will shine on this very football religious country.

137
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,960
It's 50/50. It's now or never.

138
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,800
Despite being only two penalties into the shootout

139
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,120
the extreme passion and emotional attachment

140
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,760
Argentina places on this game

141
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,280
was already on full display.

142
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,640
And then came the next Dutch penalty...

143
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,840
It’s like they can’t win, easily...

144
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,960
And so after a match that had given us just about everything.

145
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,200
Argentina were just one Lautaro Martinez penalty away

146
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,600
from the Semi Finals.

147
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,400
We go one step closer!

148
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,840
Finally, after a two and a half hour emotional rollercoaster ride

149
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,560
that only this country, in this game could go through

150
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,680
Argentina had snuck into the Semi-Final.

151
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,480
And whilst there were cries of happiness

152
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,520
hugs of relief

153
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,880
and jumping for joy.

154
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,520
There were also tears.

155
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,400
Where it was evident the emotional toll

156
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,560
of supporting this team in this tournament

157
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,640
was becoming overbearing for some.

158
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,280
Especially knowing there were still two more matches

159
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,600
they’d have to overcome

160
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,680
to finally achieve their World Cup dream

161
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,960
for the first time in nearly 40 years.

162
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,160
And so as some hung around to hear the words

163
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,160
of the man of the match.

164
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,640
We left the fan zone as that 37 degree heat wave...

165
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,440
turned into something completely different.

166
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,520
And came across local juice vendor Chino.

167
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,520
Who, in a sign of the dire economic times of the country

168
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,960
wasn’t able to leave his juice stand to watch the game,

169
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,800
instead, listening to it outside the fan zone on his radio.

170
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,760
I was with an old lady here.

171
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,960
And when we heard the goal we both hugged each other.

172
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,960
With that old lady.

173
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,280
And we both shouted.

174
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,840
And I told hèr: "If they score one more goal...

175
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,240
I'll eat your mouth!"

176
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,040
And so as we headed out to the Obelisco

177
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,800
where we’d been told despite the monsoon like rain conditions

178
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,240
thousands had already gathered

179
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,800
for the traditional post win celebrations.

180
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,680
It was Chino’s poetic words on what this all meant

181
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,120
that made sense of it all.

182
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,880
It is not about Messi or any other player.

183
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,440
It's about hope.

184
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,360
The hope of the people.

185
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,880
Half an hour ago we were all like this! Suffering!

186
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,400
And in one second, one second...

187
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,440
the door of happiness opened.

188
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,960
Where no one gives a damn, about anything and nothing...

189
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,280
..it takes you out of one place and puts you in another one.

190
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,000
It's like a dimensional doorway.

191
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,120
The next morning came with a combination of

192
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,280
jetlag, wet clothes and a hangover.

193
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,360
But mostly a sense of disbelief into what we had just experienced

194
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,040
only 24 hours into our time in Argentina.

195
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,360
So to start the day I headed to meet Santi again.

196
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,120
Who wore the exact same shirt

197
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,480
and insisted we met and did the interview in the exact same place.

198
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,080
All for one very Argentine phenomenon.

199
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,080
I mean, it’s the “Cabalas”

200
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,040
Oh ok, the Cabalas, I keep hearing about the “Cabalas”

201
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,560
It’s a belief that if you,

202
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,600
when you did something and it worked out...

203
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,120
you want to repeat that thing so that

204
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,320
that it might yield the same result.

205
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,480
I mean look at me for example.

206
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,720
I mean, I need a shave.

207
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,120
I need a haircut.

208
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,040
And I don’t want to do any of those things because

209
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,240
whilst not getting shaved and not getting haircuts

210
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,400
Argentina have reached this far into this World Cup.

211
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,760
But Santi wasn’t the only one affected by the World Cup “Cabalas”

212
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,240
I wear the same shoes. I wake up at the same time.

213
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,040
I haven't washed my shirt in a month.

214
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,600
We sit in the exact same place

215
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,360
and do the exact same things on matchdays.

216
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,160
When Argentina plays, we make ʻpicada’.

217
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,680
We don't wear a jersey, because in the Copa America that we won

218
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,920
we also didn't do it.

219
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,040
And as long as Argentina keeps winning, we keep making picada.

220
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,680
We use the same chairs in the same order

221
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,720
and we eat the same before every match.

222
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,160
It's about trying to do the same things you did on the day you won.

223
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,360
From their superstitious behaviour

224
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,960
to painting their futsal arenas like the Sistine Chapel

225
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,200
it was dawning on me that the Argentinian passion for football

226
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,320
genuinely bordered on religious fervour.

227
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,600
It's portraying Maradona,

228
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,600
passing onto Messi...

229
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,400
the creation of football.

230
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,560
But, this was only the tip of the iceberg I discovered

231
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,600
when it came to Argentine passion for all things football.

232
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,240
From Ezequiel Suranyi the founder of Futbolitis,

233
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,720
a creative art studio dedicated to the game.

234
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,440
It’s not a sport, it goes way beyond.

235
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,920
It’s a cultural phenomenon

236
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,360
that affects different lives in different ways.

237
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,480
To the unofficial Museum of El Grafico

238
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,640
built into a tin shed in the countryside

239
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,840
that’s dedicated to preserving the memory

240
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,400
of the country’s most adored football publication.

241
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,640
To Carlos Ruiz

242
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,640
a man who turned his passion for sportswear

243
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,160
into a world famous store

244
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,760
visited by some of the biggest names in the world.

245
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,680
And whether their passion was expressed through footwear

246
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,800
or photography,

247
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,520
when chatting to them about football

248
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,280
there was one subject in particular

249
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,920
that was getting them most excited.

250
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,760
We have the best player in the world.

251
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,400
Messi, right now, is waking up.

252
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,640
Fifth World Cup my friend.

253
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,360
Players usually play three, at the most.

254
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,560
And whilst yes, they were gushing about his on pitch performance,

255
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,440
it was what Messi did off the pitch against one Dutch player

256
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,040
that had Argentinians most enamoured.

257
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,760
No one ever thought Messi could do that.

258
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,400
THE ‘BOBO’ (DUMMY) COULDN’T DEAL WITH IT

259
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,640
It’s another Messi.

260
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,960
He’s older, he’s wiser.

261
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,800
He doesn’t take shit from people.

262
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,240
We’ve seen him lash out, we’ve seen him complain,

263
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,120
we’ve seen him be aggressive.

264
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,040
#WHATAREYOULOOKINGATDUMMY

265
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,040
But to be straight looking at someone, looking at an opponent.

266
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,800
Telling them: What are you looking at?

267
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,240
Get out of here! Get out of here!

268
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,520
Just like in ‘86

269
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,760
Argentina once again had a leader

270
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,320
who wasn’t afraid to express how he felt.

271
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,520
And within hours they were celebrating it

272
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,760
in every way they could.

273
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,880
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT DUMMY?

274
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,080
This is the World Cup legacy in Argentina.

275
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,000
Messi says one line, within days...

276
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,960
it’s on shirts, hats, mugs.

277
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,960
How did he get this shirt made so quickly?

278
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,520
You know, on Friday when the match was finished

279
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,360
maybe 20 minutes after there were tops and T-Shirts

280
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,320
already on sale.

281
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,200
This is the power of this tournament.

282
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,080
This sport.

283
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,920
This player.

284
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,440
And if they win it bet you it all sells out.

285
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,840
Day by day we were watching Argentina’s World Cup hysteria grow

286
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,680
In more weird and wondrous ways

287
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,480
Even the chicken nuggets...

288
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,360
have been World Cup-ified

289
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,360
in Argentina.

290
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,520
Every single radio station.

291
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,560
Every single one

292
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,120
is playing World Cup.

293
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,960
They thought that they had it sorted...

294
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,520
but they had to sort it through penalties.'

295
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,040
World Cup...

296
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,880
'The Physio Luis Martin says:

297
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,480
"The players are playing at a high intensity.”

298
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,120
World Cup...

299
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,760
A game from their World Cup.'

300
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,040
It’s all World Cup.

301
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,800
Whether it’s the walls.

302
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,840
Whether it’s the radio.

303
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,560
Whether it’s the newspapers.

304
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,120
Everything is World Cup.

305
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,120
It’d probably harder to not hear the World Cup

306
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,640
than hear about the World Cup.

307
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,840
But perhaps the reason the World Cup was such a talking point...

308
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,400
was because the other Argentine topic of discussion

309
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,720
was so depressing.

310
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,160
So inflation for example it’s a huge, huge issue in Argentina.

311
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:59,240
It's impossible for a middle-class Argentinian to have savings.

312
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,585
ONLY 9.6% OF ARGENTINIANSCOULD SAVE IN 2022

313
00:17:03,585 --> 00:17:05,760
INFLATION AVALANCHE

314
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,440
This is a really good indication of the inflation here in Argentina.

315
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,840
We keep seeing signs like this missing numbers, because

316
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,680
well, when the price keeps changing that quickly

317
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,280
there’s no point just changing it from, I don’t know

318
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,840
something like, 1200 today to 2,000 next month

319
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,040
maybe 2,500 the week after who knows.

320
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,200
They can’t buy houses.

321
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,280
They can’t buy cars.

322
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,760
They can’t actually make investments.

323
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,000
Because the money just becomes worth less and less every day?

324
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,520
Exactly!

325
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,200
It’s burning in their pockets!

326
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,160
And so as each day went by...

327
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,000
we came across demonstration

328
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,560
after demonstration,

329
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,120
after demonstration.

330
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,560
All focused on the same subject.

331
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,600
They've offered us indexes that are bebw inilation!

332
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,680
We've turned them down!

333
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,160
And we've launched anongoing strike

334
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,400
that we are doing all across Argentina!

335
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,320
Yet even amongst the protests

336
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,560
Diego was present.

337
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,680
And even in the economic nadir the country had found itself in

338
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,040
reports coming out of Qatar

339
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,920
were that no country had taken as many fans to the tournament

340
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,840
as Argentina.

341
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,880
And with the country now in the Semi-Finals

342
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,600
somehow even more supporters were flying out to Doha.

343
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,760
So of course we headed to the airport to meet them.

344
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,480
From the young and spontaneous.

345
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,400
We won against the Netherlands and said, "Let's go.”

346
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,640
We weren't going to go to this World Cup.

347
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,040
To the old and sentimental.

348
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,720
Sure. I'm 60 years old.

349
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,080
This will be my last chance to see Messi.

350
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,440
To the just plain crazy.

351
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,920
Yes， we sold our car to g

352
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,960
For an Argentinian to go to a World Cup,

353
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,280
It’s not pleasure, it’s business.

354
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,960
You sold your car?

355
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,320
Just to go to Doha, your dad sold his car?

356
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,240
You go there to achieve an objective.

357
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:48,960
Not to have fun.

358
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,200
The thing is， we re all crazy.

359
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,200
We want to go encourage our country.

360
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,240
It was an act of emotion.

361
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,040
Another match day had come round

362
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,960
and with it, another scorcher.

363
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,480
This time with the temperature predicted to hit nearly 40 degrees.

364
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,160
But a heatwave was no match for Argentinians

365
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,640
in a World Cup Semi-Final.

366
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,800
And so with the crowd at the the Buenos Aires fan zone

367
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,800
expected to be double the last match.

368
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,360
We sent one camera in early to find a space

369
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,880
whilst we sent another to roam the streets of Buenos Aires

370
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,880
and capture the almost paralysing effect this tournament had

371
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,040
on nearly every corner of the capital.

372
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,040
As for me well, since this was a story about Argentina

373
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,320
not just Buenos Aires.

374
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,400
I decided to try something a little different.

375
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,720
Heading out of the capital and across the country

376
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,360
to see just what the rest of Argentina looks and feels like

377
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,080
on a World Cup match day.

378
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,760
And what I found was arguably a more intense sentiment

379
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,760
than even in the capital.

380
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,680
If we don't win now， that's it.

381
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,160
This is our last one， this is the one we must win.

382
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,920
That's why it has to be now or never.

383
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,560
It's because of Messi， as well. Because he deserves it.

384
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,760
The world has to gift him the World Cup.

385
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,760
Because it's unique.

386
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,400
Because we're good and we have the players to win this.

387
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,320
Basically it's now or never!

388
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,120
This one is all or nothing!

389
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,560
And just like the emotional toll

390
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,240
the tournament was having on those in the city.

391
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,240
Why don't you watch?

392
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,720
To not get nervous.

393
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,680
I have to take it very easy

394
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,680
because in the last game l almost died.

395
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,080
i get anxiety, so l try not to watch and do a bit of work.

396
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,480
And despite being the middle of a Tuesday

397
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,600
Every town.

398
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,680
Every village.

399
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,560
And everyone was focused on one thing in particular...

400
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,520
And so as the kick off approached

401
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,080
we jumped back on the highway

402
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,040
and headed to the city known as the “Cradle of Football”.

403
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,520
I’m from Buenos Aires, but when you have to look at

404
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,560
how they feel football in Rosario.

405
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,560
I mean, they are crazy about football in there.

406
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,480
I have to admit it.

407
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,960
Rosario breathes football like no other city in Argentina.

408
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,880
For sure.

409
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,200
In Rosario they probably take football way too seriously

410
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,160
Way too heavily.

411
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,080
It gets crazy in there as well.

412
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,400
Firstly, it’s the two clubs of Rosario.

413
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,440
From the moment you enter Rosario

414
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,040
you understand the passion.

415
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,200
How deep it goes.

416
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,920
The colours are everywhere.

417
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,080
Onto every wall.

418
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,040
Every corner.

419
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,280
Every lamp post.

420
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,320
It’s all about:

421
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,600
The Red and Black of Newell’s

422
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,000
or the Blue and Yellow of Rosario Central.

423
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,040
A level of division.

424
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,280
A level of hate.

425
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,960
A level of passion.

426
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,160
It goes toward a level that is...

427
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,280
difficult to understand.

428
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,160
There’s way too much intensity.

429
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,920
But maybe that’s what created...

430
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,480
Messi.

431
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,720
You see it was in this cradle of football

432
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,320
that Messi was born, raised and began his footballing odyssey.

433
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,560
Messi’s first club was ‘Grandoli’

434
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,520
a small football club in the South of Rosario.

435
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,000
And so with Messi’s Rosarino football journey

436
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,320
starting at Grandoli.

437
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,400
So did ours...

438
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,280
Can we go in?

439
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,440
It’s just mad to think, like

440
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,280
it all started...

441
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:33,880
here.

442
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,520
At Grandoli.

443
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,480
On that pitch.

444
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,880
Where he did the same magic he’s been performing

445
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,200
from five years old here

446
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,360
to 35 now.

447
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,560
But to sit here, in this kind of...

448
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,760
birthplace, of...

449
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,320
what could be the greatest player of all time.

450
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,080
What could almost certainly be

451
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,240
if he wins this tournament, in less than a week.

452
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,520
I don’t know, it’s magic.

453
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,040
I could stay here all day and soak it up, but...

454
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,680
we got kick off against Croatia in about 15 minutes.

455
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,800
I’ve been invited to a party...

456
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,720
That party was being hosted by Farid

457
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,360
a talented Rosarino photographer I’d seen online.

458
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,120
Whose photos in Rosario’s World Cup celebrations

459
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,880
had inspired me to come to the city in the first place.

460
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,040
And so as the streets of Buenos Aires emptied

461
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,040
and it’s bars, restaurants and fan zones filled to capacity.

462
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,200
We made it to Farid’s just in time

463
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,480
to strap ourselves in for another ride

464
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,520
on the emotional rollercoaster that is

465
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,120
supporting Argentina at the World Cup.

466
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,520
And from the first minute in, it was a bumpy ride.

467
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,160
It threw some Argentine hands in the air

468
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,440
and other Argentine hands on heads.

469
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,920
It threw some of us forward.

470
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,640
It threw some of us back.

471
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,840
But whoever you were.

472
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,400
Wherever you were.

473
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,080
No one was immune from the emotional toll.

474
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,200
Some tried coping with nicotine.

475
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,720
Others with alcohol.

476
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,240
Some even tried coping with black magic.

477
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,080
And then...

478
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,120
And so that emotional rollercoaster had come to a screeching halt.

479
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,000
Where the result of Messi’s next kick

480
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,760
would determine where we go next.

481
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,160
12 yards.

482
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,400
1 Kick.

483
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,560
46 million people.

484
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,280
A 36 year wait.

485
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,960
Messi had put Argentina in the lead of a World Cup Semi-Final

486
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,800
and the fairytale was back on track.

487
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,800
And whilst I could try and explain what it felt like,

488
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,560
the faces amongst the celebrations tell it best.

489
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,360
And before the tears of joy could even dry

490
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,440
the kids in the air could even land

491
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,520
and the kisses could even be delivered...

492
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,680
Once again, the faces told the story.

493
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,520
And 2 - 0 up and now dominating

494
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,960
Argentina had a foot firmly in the door of the World Cup Final.

495
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,120
And with the post goal ecstasy contagious and Half-Time called.

496
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,160
The stress and suffering endured in that first half hour

497
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,560
had been replaced with smiles,

498
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,080
celebrations,

499
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,560
Cinzano,

500
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:54,040
and singing in the sunshine at Argentina’s first ever

501
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,320
summertime World Cup.

502
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,600
So as the second half approached

503
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,880
and I prepared for what I thought would be

504
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,520
a celebratory 45 minutes

505
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,320
I found myself in for a rude surprise.

506
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,320
As the moment the second half kicked off....

507
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,240
The mood instantly changed.

508
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,200
Something that I’ve noticed throughout the World Cup is that...

509
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,760
Even in the way the Argentines cheer on their team,

510
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,040
it feels like they are suffering.

511
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,800
They are leaving their voice behind.

512
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,880
They have to be mentally drained.

513
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,480
They have to be at the...

514
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,600
top of intensity because they are suffering.

515
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,640
So that’s how we live football.

516
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,880
We live football through hardship.

517
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,720
We live football through...

518
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,240
excruciating pain, you know?

519
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,600
And whether it was the Argentinian style of suffering as support

520
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,480
or the fact that 2-0 was the same scoreline

521
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,640
they had before they imploded against the Dutch.

522
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,640
No one in the fanzone.

523
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,840
No one in the cafes.

524
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,280
And certainly no one in Rosario

525
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,120
seemed to remember the happiness of Half Time.

526
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,080
Until...

527
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,680
Messi picked up the ball near the halfway line...

528
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,200
And he ran with it.

529
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,360
And he ran with it.

530
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,280
And he ran with it some more.

531
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,080
Until he had the ball at the byline.

532
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,880
And whilst he didn’t pass to Molina...

533
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,960
he did pass it to Alvarez.

534
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,440
And that’s when Argentina finally let their guard down.

535
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,880
No longer was anyone worried about the game.

536
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,080
In fact no one was even watching it.

537
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,040
And so as the Buenos Aires fan zone turned into a giant dance floor.

538
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,720
The streets of the capital refilled

539
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,680
with people heading to the Obelisco

540
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,720
and our watch party turned into a rave...

541
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,560
I went outside to get my head around the story that was unfolding.

542
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,200
Well I’ve had to take a step outside on the balcony because

543
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,760
as fun as it is in there, it’s a bit overwhelming to be honest.

544
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,000
I came up with the idea of telling this story over a year ago.

545
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,520
When I realised it was going to be Argentina’s

546
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,880
first Summer World Cup.

547
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,880
When I realised it was their first since Maradona passed

548
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,600
and that he was looking down on them for this tournament.

549
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,640
And when I realised this really was Messi’s last tournament.

550
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,160
He’s said it surely was...

551
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,520
and he’s played like it surely was.

552
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,040
He’s just created an assist so glorious, so beautiful

553
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,840
it’ll go down in the history of this tournament.

554
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,480
And now this country...

555
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:30,400
to actually try and fathom what happens with this country.

556
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,680
I don’t know what happens over the next five days to be honest.

557
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,640
What happens now Argentina?

558
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,760
How do you prepare for this?

559
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,560
How do you enjoy this?

560
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,760
And if you win this, how do you celebrate this?

561
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,120
We are in for something special now.

562
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,680
I’m telling you, you thought it was crazy now.

563
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,160
I feel like we haven’t seen anything yet.

564
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,200
And so we hit the streets

565
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,320
to see how Rosarinos celebrate the World Cup.

566
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,760
Where whether on the back of a bike,

567
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,400
back of a truck,

568
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,400
back of the bus,

569
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,160
or even at the front of it.

570
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,560
There was only one place you were heading...

571
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,480
The city’s own version of the Obelisco gathering.

572
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,680
Where tens of thousands had congregated,

573
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,400
many climbing any vantage point possible

574
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,560
to show what it meant.

575
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,440
Meanwhile at the Obelisco

576
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,120
It had gone to another level.

577
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,040
With bikes,

578
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,840
barbecues

579
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,040
and brass bands

580
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,880
And so as the celebrations continued

581
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,560
deep into the night and morning.

582
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,480
What was most notable to me were the number of young kids

583
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,360
out way past their bed time, partying alongside their parents

584
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,920
who evidently wanted their kids to experience the same

585
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:03,920
Argentine euphoria they were able to enjoy three decades earlier.

586
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,920
And so as the drinks ran out

587
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,760
and we headed back to the capital.

588
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,240
All I could think was...

589
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,240
How does this get any bigger?
