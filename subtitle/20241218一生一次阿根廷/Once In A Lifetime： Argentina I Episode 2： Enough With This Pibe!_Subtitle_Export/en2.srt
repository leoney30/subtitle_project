1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
Right, so we’ve had to hop back in the car.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,000
We’re not even able to watch the penalty.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,800
A fight almost kicked off,

4
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,640
the man left and came back with a gun.

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,400
I swear, you saw it right?

6
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,320
Yeah.

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,200
My name’s Eli Mengem and for the past few years

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,760
I’ve been traversing Europe, documenting the tales

9
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,400
of football clubs and their fanbases

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,520
who’ve been on the verge of winning something

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,320
for the first time in a long time...

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,360
If not ever.

13
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,280
From Northern Turkey

14
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,560
to Southern Spain.

15
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,760
From South West Germany

16
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,040
to the Basque country.

17
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,640
I’ve been on a mission to show how important it is

18
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,600
that the game has a variety of winners

19
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,360
So that we learn about new places.

20
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,360
New people.

21
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,160
New cultures.

22
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,280
And most importantly, new stories.

23
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,960
Then came the 2022 FIFA World Cup

24
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,760
Where I knew the exact Once in a Lifetime story I had to tell.

25
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,640
So as the World’s media descended on Qatar

26
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,720
to be at the tournament.

27
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,920
COPA90 and I decided to fly 8000 miles in the opposite direction

28
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,720
to tell the ultimate story of a football fanbase

29
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,120
on the brink of ending a 36 year wait

30
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,200
for the biggest prize in sport.

31
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,960
But what we found we found was a story that transcended football.

32
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,160
A story that reached into the very soul of a nation

33
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,840
that laid itself bare over two fateful weeks.

34
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,160
a story that etched a struggle for identity in a search for glory

35
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,080
that began over two centuries ago.

36
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,760
A story about Lionel Messi.

37
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,000
Argentina.

38
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,040
and 45 million people yearning to reclaim

39
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,240
their place in history

40
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,600
This is the all angle, on the ground

41
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,800
as it happened

42
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,760
ultimate account

43
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,320
of perhaps the greatest football story of our time

44
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,600
How many years have you been covering football?

45
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,160
I’ve been working in football 24 years now.

46
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,000
And how many matches do you think you’ve covered?

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,480
2,000? Something like that.

48
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,640
Have you ever seen a footballer like Messi?

49
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,040
No.

50
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:53,960
Not close.

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,200
You know, his level of consistency is astonishing.

52
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,320
But for what? 17, 18 years...

53
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,920
he scored 30 goals a season,

54
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,400
got 15, 20 assists a season.

55
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,120
And nobody...

56
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,200
in the entire history of football

57
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,560
has had anything like that level.

58
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,280
Born and raised in Argentina’s second city of Rosario

59
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,040
the moment Lionel Andrés Messi took to the uneven pitch

60
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,440
of his local football club, Grandoli,

61
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,200
the game of football changed forever.

62
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,240
And he starts dribbling past everybody

63
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,880
and suddenly his brothers realise...

64
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,120
This isn’t normal.

65
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,840
By 7 he’s signed to boyhood club Newell’s Old Boys.

66
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,880
By 13 he’s signed by FC Barcelona.

67
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,760
By 16 he’s already in their first squad

68
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,600
and by 21 he’s the star of Pep Guardiola’s legendary side.

69
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,160
They’re the greatest team I’ve ever seen.

70
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,600
And Messi is the best player

71
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,920
in the best team I’ve ever seen.

72
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,120
He’s what takes that side and turns it from being

73
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,680
very, very, very good to

74
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,800
utterly exceptional.

75
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,880
The next decade and a half sees Messi achieve

76
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,560
every club and individual award several times over

77
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,240
with goals, assists and performances that truly defy belief.

78
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,480
But don’t take my word for it...

79
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,960
Lionel for me is the best.

80
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,120
He’s a one off for me

81
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,640
and it was just great to be in the same stadium as him.

82
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,240
But Leo is just a freak.

83
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,560
What he does, it’s unheard of, I mean I never...

84
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,520
I don’t know if you will see that ever again.

85
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,280
Then there’s his stats with the club.

86
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,160
10 La Ligas.

87
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,800
7 Copa Del Reys.

88
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,040
4 Champions Leagues.

89
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,680
3 FIFA club World Cups.

90
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,400
534 goals and 303 assists.

91
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,480
Each and every season

92
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,960
Messi seemed to raised the bar to new heights

93
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,440
for FC Barcelona.

94
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,120
But, back in Argentina...

95
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,880
things are a bit more complicated.

96
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,040
And Messi is like...

97
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,720
I don’t know....

98
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,400
- Wait you still believe that to this day?

99
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,320
Yes, to this day.

100
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,200
You see for many Argentinians, as happy as they were to see

101
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,720
a compatriot at the top of world football again.

102
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,840
The reality was:

103
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,120
Whilst he may have won everything at Barca...

104
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,840
When it comes to Argentina

105
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,600
despite his record amount of goals and assists for the country,

106
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,840
whenever Messi went to a tournament with the national team

107
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,480
they came home empty handed.

108
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,680
Messi is like...

109
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,240
having a son that you know can do better.

110
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,760
He can do better.

111
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,920
But he’s not doing it.

112
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,840
There’s this desperate desire

113
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,360
for him to pick up from Maradona

114
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,160
for him to lead them to glory.

115
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,000
When that doesn’t happen

116
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,240
there’s this intense frustration.

117
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,920
Deep inside we love him, but....

118
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,520
he needs to win!

119
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,000
He needs to win, you know.

120
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,800
That’s it.

121
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,520
Of course they’re proud of what he does for Barcelona.

122
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,360
But he’s doing it for Barcelona.

123
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,880
Argentina fans want him to do it for Argentina.

124
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,400
This country, with all of its difficulties and flaws

125
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,680
expects him to play like a God.

126
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,840
But surely the idea is Messi must lead them to glory

127
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,880
and it doesn’t happen.

128
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,000
Firstly, there’s the World Cup heartbreak.

129
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,560
Where in 2006 he only plays a bit part role

130
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,280
which sees a quarter final exit.

131
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,720
In 2010, he plays every match but once again

132
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,920
they’re out in the quarters.

133
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,280
Then came the 2014 World Cup in Brazil

134
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,040
where Messi scores 4 goals, earns player of the tournament

135
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,640
and leads Argentina to their first final in 24 years.

136
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,160
But he took you to a World Cup Final!

137
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,560
Yes, but we didn’t win.

138
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,000
And it’s like that for you?

139
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,240
Who remembers the guy who came in second?

140
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,520
I mean it’s ludicrous...

141
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,560
and I suspect most of them know it’s ludicrous

142
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,640
but that doesn’t stop the yearning.

143
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,200
And that thing, you know, inside of me

144
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,320
even if I know, logically that it’s not OK

145
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,120
it’s still there lingering somewhere.

146
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,160
It’s a mix of the way of the Argentinian

147
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,520
and so many years of not being able to actually win it.

148
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,480
Sometimes coming really close, like in Brazil.

149
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,680
It was like a dream to come true win it in Brazil

150
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,960
at the Maracana stadium.

151
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,560
But I’m willing to say this.

152
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,600
If he would have scored a goal in 2014

153
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,280
and we would have won the World Cup in Brazil...

154
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,120
Everything would be different.

155
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,240
Argentina fans want him to do it for Argentina.

156
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,360
Maradona did it for Argentina.

157
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,480
Why can’t Messi?

158
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,960
If he’s so good, why can’t he do this?

159
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,080
But his performance wasn't even half as good

160
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,800
as what he did with Barcelona.

161
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,000
Even me, I couldn't believe why he was so good in Barcelona...

162
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,560
but not in our national team.

163
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,880
No, I wasn't convinced by him that much...

164
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,560
because he was in Maradona's shadow.

165
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,120
But in speaking to younger Argentinians it’s evident

166
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,680
that this isn’t a sentiment shared by all.

167
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,840
Who's better? Messi or Maradona?

168
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,320
Messi.

169
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,520
The younger generation lives football a very different way.

170
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,200
lzzy said he prefers Maradona.

171
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,320
Ah but me, I prefer Argentina.

172
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,280
It’s a globalised generation

173
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,360
that sees football in a different way to the older generation.

174
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,040
It was really, really tough on Messi for me.

175
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,560
You don’t think it was justified?

176
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,880
No, not at all..

177
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,760
So the younger generation has never seen Argentina

178
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,720
reach the heights in the game

179
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,760
and so there is that tension.

180
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,840
I mean I’ve heard stories my whole life...

181
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,800
of my parents talking about:

182
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,840
86, Maradona...

183
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,200
and I’ve been fed those stories constantly

184
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,760
whilst never, quite,

185
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,160
watching it for myself.

186
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,160
How much does your dad tell you about ‘86?

187
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,920
How much do you hear about ‘86?

188
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,240
Yeah, since I was born.

189
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,040
Maybe twice a week he reminds me.

190
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,080
When we drive in the car and there’s not much to talk about...

191
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,120
He tells me: No because in ‘86 we did that! We did this!

192
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,160
The stories that I have

193
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,880
I could write it down because they’re always the same.

194
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,640
In 1986, I was one (year old).

195
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,560
However me and my whole generation

196
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,560
have seen every game.

197
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,960
There's a very classic Argentinian film called ‘Heroes’,

198
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,000
when I was young, lwatch tover and over again.

199
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,880
As soon as I got back from school, I'd play It.

200
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,280
And I'd see Diego, and then Diego and then Diego.

201
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,040
There's no one my age that doesn't know

202
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,360
Victor Hugo's commentary by heart.

203
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,440
Istill watch the goals of Diego.

204
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,320
We watch it on repeat in the house, the documentaries.

205
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,800
There's a movie about the 1986 World Cup that we always watch.d

206
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,640
Yes.

207
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,720
'The Impossible Champion'.

208
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,360
It's beautiful.

209
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,840
Well the older generation said:

210
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,600
You never saw Argentina reach the heights,

211
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,480
you never saw a player

212
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,240
like we saw Maradona in his heyday.

213
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,200
Do you think there’s a difference in generation and that

214
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,040
older people are stuck in the past and they

215
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,560
they’re looking at it with rose tinted glasses?

216
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,760
Yeah, but that’s football, right?

217
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,240
It’s the experience that surround you, that define you.

218
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,640
I like to, it’s a way to, how can I say?

219
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,720
Relive my childhood.

220
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,640
I don’t know.

221
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,680
But I really want to win.

222
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,160
And so with Argentinian media generally populated by

223
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,920
people of a similar age and therefore mentality

224
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,800
and perhaps even nostalgia.

225
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,960
Messi, despite becoming Argentina’s leading goalscorer

226
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,760
became a target for those wanting to relive their childhood.

227
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,160
(Messi) has to play better at national team level.

228
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,640
It's his duty and it's his responsibility.

229
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,720
We won't spare Messi from that responsibility.

230
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,040
Messi needs to be better for the national team.

231
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,160
And no more so was this the case,

232
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,080
than at one particular tournament.

233
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,920
I think the really telling moment is 2011.

234
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,000
The Copa America.

235
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,360
In Argentina.

236
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,600
The assumption is on home soil, surely...

237
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,080
Messi can lead us to glory.

238
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,440
But he couldn’t...

239
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,480
And knocked out by Uruguay on penalties

240
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,080
Argentina’s home Copa America dream’s over by the quarter finals.

241
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,320
However it’s a group stage draw vs Colombia

242
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,520
that’s most remembered.

243
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,560
Yeah so I was there in 2011.

244
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,400
You were there?

245
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,160
I was there.

246
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,960
It was a dour game.

247
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,560
It was such an old squad.

248
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,400
In Sante Fe, so back in his home province.

249
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,760
Messi, was not at his best, at all.

250
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,160
and when the final whistle blew...

251
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,200
The whole stadium, jeered on him, booed him.

252
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,280
The whole stadium, jeered on him, booed him.

253
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,680
He's a failure, he has no balls, no soul!

254
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,560
I just, genuinely, couldn’t believe what I was hearing.

255
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,120
You could sense that it was against Messi

256
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,520
not just against the team.

257
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:39,600
not just against the team.

258
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,640
I've always supported him all my life but it can't be like this!

259
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,640
Argentinians booed Messi?

260
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,760
I can’t even fathom it.

261
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,000
He was not just booed.

262
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,280
He was booed in his own province.

263
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,720
Wow.

264
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:51,800
Wow.

265
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,640
By the looks of it we can't win anything with Messi.

266
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,760
We want to win something and we're tired.

267
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,720
How long has it been since we've won something?

268
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,120
Keep in mind, this is peak Messi!

269
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,800
2011 Messi!

270
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,600
Champions League winner!

271
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Ballon D’or!

272
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,800
That final against United!

273
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,120
That’s why people were so angry at him because

274
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,920
they were watching Messi at Barcelona winning everything

275
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,520
tearing opponents to shreds

276
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,120
and they were asking:

277
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,960
Why can’t we have that Messi

278
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,560
for ourselves?

279
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,240
ELI: What was your reaction when you heard the jeering?

280
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,080
My reaction was...

281
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,120
My reaction was...

282
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,960
He gets it, but then he doesn't use it like at Barcelona.

283
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,720
Damn Barcelona.

284
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,320
It was completely breaking us because

285
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,120
we wanted to look like Barcelona, we wanted to train like Barcelona.

286
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,120
We wanted to play like Barcelona.

287
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,880
And we were unable to do that.

288
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,760
We were not Barcelona, we had no Guardiola.

289
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,200
But at the core of the criticism

290
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,320
it wasn’t so much about Messi’s skills

291
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,120
as it was about something deeper.

292
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,200
I think it was before the Colombia game...

293
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,600
and I went to a wine tasting.

294
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,880
And the women in charge of the vineyard,

295
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,880
I was talking to her about football.

296
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,400
And she was saying we should drop Messi

297
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,920
and it should be all about Carlos Tevez.

298
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,040
And I was just saying, but...

299
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,960
What do you mean?

300
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,840
Have you seen Messi?

301
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,240
And she was like, no, no...

302
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,280
Tevez has got it here.

303
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,080
And for Argentinians, it’s there that counts the most.

304
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,040
He's a 'Pecho Frio' walking around the pitch.

305
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,760
“Pecho Frio” a cold chest.

306
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,200
A bottler.

307
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,120
Being a 'Pecho Frío' means not having any blood.

308
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,560
'Pecho Frío' means a player that doesn't really give his all.

309
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,800
It’s someone who can’t produce the goods when it matters.

310
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,120
Like their blood isn't hot enough to do what they have to do.

311
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,760
Or like they don't care about the final score.

312
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,360
And with that there’s the personality.

313
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,240
You see Pecho Frio is just as much as a critique of the person

314
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,440
as it is the performance.

315
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,360
It's someone lacking in character.

316
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,320
His problem is that he’s not very expressive.

317
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,640
Argentines are expressive.

318
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,960
They’re boisterous, they’re loud.

319
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,560
They cry, they laugh, they shout.

320
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,880
And so seeing Messi, someone who isn’t naturally that extroverted.

321
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,560
They’re two worlds that collide.

322
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,480
His demeanour...

323
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,400
goes against him.

324
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,720
Because he looks very introverted.

325
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,400
Messi was a ways very proper, very polite, respectful.

326
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,240
Regardless of how he felt.

327
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,000
Why’s that a problem?

328
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,240
Eli: In many countries that wouldn't be a problem.

329
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,280
Why is that a problem here?

330
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,120
Because we’re not in Sweden man, we’re here.

331
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,800
You’re expected to show your emotions in Argentines.

332
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,160
That’s what Argentines do.

333
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,640
And here...

334
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,360
people like to see tears.

335
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,600
Blood.

336
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,280
Sweat.

337
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,280
Sacrifice.

338
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,680
You just can’t do it. It’s sacrilegious...

339
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,440
You can’t not show your emotions.

340
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,680
We want that.

341
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,280
We like that.

342
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,160
I don’t know why.

343
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,360
But that’s the way it is.

344
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,320
And so even in his body language

345
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,040
Messi found himself in the shadow of Maradona.

346
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,040
Messi is politically correct.

347
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,480
And do you think because of that, that’s why

348
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,560
Argentinians might like Maradona a bit more?

349
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,200
Because he broke the rules?

350
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,440
He was a bit more extroverted?

351
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,800
You see for Argentinians

352
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,440
Maradona’s emotional way of being

353
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,920
is just as important

354
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,240
as anything he did on the pitch.

355
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,960
Some try to separate Maradona as a player

356
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,280
and Maradona as a person.

357
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,640
Me, I like Maradona. All of it.

358
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,640
When they ignored his repeated requests to leave him alone.

359
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,080
Maradona cracked.

360
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,080
And opened fire with an Air Rifle.

361
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,520
Diego is the ultimate expression of being Argentinian.

362
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,080
With all of our contradictions.

363
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,680
accept that Diego has many facets that I dislike,

364
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,080
that make me angry.

365
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,600
But I also identify with them.

366
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,960
But criticism of Messi didn’t stop at his supposed Pecho Frio.

367
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,320
There’s been many criticism of Messi.

368
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,120
What are some of the ones you’ve heard of in the past?

369
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,640
Way too many of them..

370
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,640
He’s more Catalan than Argentine.

371
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,520
He has never played for an Argentinian club.

372
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:02,600
He has never played for an Argentinian club.

373
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,880
Perhaps if he played for Boca.

374
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,600
He walks around the pitch.

375
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,680
He doesn't run like he used to.

376
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,000
But there had been this question mark of

377
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,760
how Argentinian does he really feel?

378
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,080
In the sense that he doesn’t feel the Argentine shirt

379
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,640
in the same way as...

380
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,160
someone like Carlos Tevez for example.

381
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,160
‘The player of the people’

382
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,960
Does he sing the anthem loudly enough?

383
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,280
No! No! I want him to sing the anthem like Maradona did!

384
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,320
Enough with this pibe!

385
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,480
Meanwhile, right after leading Argentina

386
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,080
to that 2014 World Cup final.

387
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,640
Messi leads Argentina to the Copa America final in 2015 and ‘16.

388
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,040
Yet both times they heartbreakingly lose on penalties.

389
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,840
He’s lost these three finals in successive years

390
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,640
and he’s devastated.

391
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,720
He was fed up, he had missed the penalty in the shootout.

392
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,600
You talk to players who were there and apparently

393
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,000
Messi in the dressing room is just sitting on the floor

394
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,920
between benches

395
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,680
just weeping.

396
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,200
It was a Messi that didn't feel like his country

397
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,200
And I think he just sort of thought:

398
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,040
I can’t take this anymore, I can’t take...

399
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,560
annual disappointment.

400
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,560
And it’s always him who gets blamed.

401
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,480
And he was fed up.

402
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,240
He was over with it. He said:

403
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,080
That's it.

404
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,680
It's over for me with the national team.

405
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,160
As I said before, it's been four finals.

406
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,000
And he then quit international football.

407
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,560
And that’s when Messi found out

408
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,000
how Argentina really feels about him.

409
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,840
They begged for Messi to come back.

410
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,720
People went to the...

411
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,520
went to the streets to ask for Messi to come back.

412
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,320
Yeah, there were people taking to the streets.

413
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,240
It was this constant campaign.

414
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,800
Uniting behind the campaign message

415
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,240
‘No Te Vayas Leo’ or ‘Leo don’t go’

416
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,760
A nationwide campaign began

417
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,480
to convince Messi to reconsider.

418
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,520
The “No Te Vayas” campaign was everywhere.

419
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,400
It was on street signs, on banners.

420
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,680
Even in the underground.

421
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,160
And they realise a future without Messi

422
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,400
is a worse future.

423
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,760
It makes them less likely to win things.

424
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,440
Sorry for being so emotional but it's how I feel.

425
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,640
My brother did.

426
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,000
He actually went onto the streets?

427
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,040
Where? To the Obelisk?

428
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,720
Yeah.

429
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,160
Oh seriously!?! They went to the Obelisk?

430
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,920
To ask for Messi to come back!?!

431
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,760
Yeah...

432
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,400
El Obelisco it's a giant structure in the middle of

433
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,320
July 9 Avenue in Buenos Aires.

434
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,760
It became the symbol of Buenos Aires.

435
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,120
It became a symbol, also, of Argentina.

436
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,840
And it’s the place that football fans have chosen

437
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,480
to celebrate their own victories.

438
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,440
So I think the fans going to the Obelisco

439
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,320
to claim Messi to be back in the national team

440
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,200
was a counter culture protest.

441
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,800
And reflecting how much he meant to them in particular

442
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,800
it was the reaction of Argentina’s youth

443
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,200
that was making the biggest impact.

444
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,120
Don't go! If you do， we won't reach any more finals!

445
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,600
From handwritten letters.

446
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,200
To emotional outbursts.

447
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,680
It was the generation still waiting for their own ‘86

448
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,760
that were leading the sentiment.

449
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:08,800
that were leading the sentiment.

450
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,440
Don't go, without you the national team is nothing!

451
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,800
I love you Leo!

452
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,000
And whether it was the crying children of his homeland

453
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,920
or just his sense of Argentinian duty

454
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,880
eventually, Messi came round.

455
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,320
But that is the moment when it changes.

456
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,000
So this new Messi

457
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,200
was suddenly there.

458
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,640
And it felt like he was more willing

459
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,160
to take things by the scruff of the neck, you know?

460
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,240
We received Messi the White.

461
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,960
Like Gandalf, you know?

462
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,360
The new version of Messi.

463
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,280
Yeah. There was an evident shift in his personality.

464
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,600
He had something of a fire burning inside of him.

465
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,320
- It kind of reminded you of Maradona.

466
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,120
And so he dyes his hair, he gets more tattoos.

467
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,200
He was red carded in two games for Argentina.

468
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,360
He was squaring up to Gary Medel.

469
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,920
He also refused to receive the runners up medal

470
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,920
in the Copa America 2019.

471
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,760
He starts attacking CONMEBOL in public.

472
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,960
And l repeat, in this Copa they just wouldn't stop calling bullshit.

473
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,840
Bullshit handballs, bullshit fouls, stupid fucking penalties

474
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,200
And today they didnt even go to VAR

475
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,920
But just the fact that Messi could criticise CONMEBOL.

476
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,880
Call them corrupt.

477
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,080
That’s the South American football federation?

478
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,360
There’s a spat with the press, which he’d always been pretty good

479
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,520
with the Argentinian press before that.

480
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,720
And the people who wanted Messi to be more like Maradona

481
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,280
kind of got their wish, right?

482
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,240
Did you like that?

483
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,040
Yes.

484
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,720
Why? Because he became more Maradonian?

485
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,480
Maybe more Argentinian?

486
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,440
Because he showed he’s not Pecho Frio.

487
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,040
What did he show?

488
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,680
Character.

489
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,440
Strength.

490
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,200
Blood!

491
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,440
He showed that he has blood!

492
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,200
The retirement, and then coming back.

493
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,840
It was almost like it cleared his head.

494
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,000
He’d always been slightly cowed before that.

495
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,920
He’d sort of tried to fit in...

496
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,160
And I think he thought: Oh Actually...

497
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,720
I’ve already retired, I’ve already seen the worst.

498
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,480
So I’m just going to be me.

499
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,720
He showed he has the balls! He has the courage!

500
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,560
He's great!

501
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,480
He's great in every sense of the word! Learn to know him!

502
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,040
Those who didn't really know him before

503
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,720
met him at this Copa America.

504
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,000
He was always like this!

505
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,120
The thing is that now he's really showing himself to the world.

506
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,480
And as for the absurd idea he didn’t feel Argentinian...

507
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,160
His favourite food is Argentinian.

508
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,520
His favourite films are Argentinian.

509
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,960
His favourite music is Argentinian.

510
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,200
His wife is from Rosario

511
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,880
they’ve known each other since they were kids.

512
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,880
His whole extended family is still is in Rosario.

513
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,880
He visits them very frequently as well.

514
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,320
And of course, anybody who listens to Messi,

515
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,800
he has still got a very distinctive Argentinian accent.

516
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,760
I mean have you heard him speak?

517
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,160
Have you heard him speak?

518
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,680
He speak with not just an Argentine accent.

519
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,240
But with a Rosarino accent!

520
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,400
But nothing sums up Messi’s love and desire to play for Argentina

521
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,080
than the story of how it all began in the first place.

522
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,080
It was 2003 and Messi’s father contacted us

523
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,000
in El Grafico.

524
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,280
At the time, Spain were lurking

525
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,520
trying to convince him to play for Spain

526
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,800
and Messi didn’t consider that as an option.

527
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,640
He wanted to play for Argentina.

528
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,920
The problem is that no one knew him in Argentina

529
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,240
yet.

530
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,280
And the father of Messi asked

531
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,480
if he could send us some videos

532
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,760
so we could see him play and maybe

533
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,920
alert or notice the manager of Argentina

534
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,600
because he had no direct links to AFA (Argentinian FA).

535
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,400
I remember when we were seeing the videos,

536
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,560
these amazing videos

537
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,880
that now we know from Youtube or the internet

538
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,440
but at the time they were a treasure

539
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,880
that we received directly from Jorge Messi.

540
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,840
And of course we had to publish that story

541
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,680
make the comparison with Maradona.

542
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,760
And we contacted the national team manager at the time.

543
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,480
And it prevented Spain from convincing Messi to play for them.

544
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,320
This I think sums up

545
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,320
how much Messi always wanted to play for Argentina.

546
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,040
And so with a new Messi who evidently appreciates Argentina

547
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,920
and an Argentina feeling the same way back

548
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,480
a new connection formed.

549
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,600
The connection the players have with the national team

550
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,600
at this point is at an all time high.

551
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,320
And so when Argentina crashed out at yet another World Cup

552
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,040
this time at Russia 2018

553
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,760
whilst he still faced some backlash

554
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,080
the blame starts to shift.

555
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,560
Notably to their erratic manager Jorge Sampaoli.

556
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,160
Argentina were finally realising

557
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,240
the problems were far bigger than Messi.

558
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,400
So imagine that between 1969 and 2009

559
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,600
in 40 years, Argentina had nine permanent managers.

560
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,160
And in Messi’s 15 years in the national team

561
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,160
he had to deal with the same amount of managers.

562
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,560
When you take into account the fact that since Messi

563
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,840
made his Argentina debut

564
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,000
no manager has ever completed a World Cup cycle.

565
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,720
What, the four years?

566
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,200
The four years, no manager has ever managed that.

567
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,480
Before it was unthinkable to have a manager for less than 4 years

568
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,120
and suddenly we discovered...

569
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,400
Messi discovered that:

570
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,160
There could be two managers in one year.

571
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,520
Three managers, in the course of three years.

572
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,640
Two (FA) Presidents,

573
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,240
a normalisation committee coming in from FIFA.

574
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,760
And so the Argentinian FA went on the hunt for yet another manager.

575
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,880
So the Argentinian FA have no money

576
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,680
and they’re desperately casting around for a cheap option.

577
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,240
The cheapest they find is Sampaoli’s assistant,

578
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,200
Lionel Scaloni.

579
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,600
Who in contrast to Sampaoli and previous coaches

580
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,800
had no experience in such a role.

581
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,200
It was absolutely crazy to give the national team

582
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,360
the top job in Argentine football

583
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,320
to someone who had never coached before.

584
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,200
Scaloni had never coached?!?

585
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,880
No he was only an assistant manager.

586
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,400
And it turns out, they get really lucky...

587
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,440
Cause he’s really good.

588
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,480
But it wasn’t just tactically where Scaloni brought a change.

589
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,640
He’s very calm, he’s very laid back...

590
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,560
He’s very humble.

591
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,000
His ego is miniscule.

592
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,840
In direct contrast to the ways of Argentinian football

593
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,640
Scaloni takes a new mentality.

594
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,280
And he had this mantra he kept repeating

595
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,760
We win, we lose...

596
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,920
nobody dies, it’s fine.

597
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,400
People get too excited about football.

598
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,480
It’s only football.

599
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,960
And that I think is what Argentina needed.

600
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,960
A lot less tension in the dressing room.

601
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,600
A lot less pressure as well.

602
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,680
They have a very, very calm man.

603
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,960
So...

604
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,680
as time went by it became less and less surprising when

605
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,360
Argentina started winning games

606
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:58,880
and winning games

607
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,560
and winning games

608
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,160
because Messi was happier right there.

609
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,320
But then, just as things were clicking into place

610
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,120
for Messi and the national team.

611
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,040
There’s sad news coming through from

612
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,080
the world of football this evening.

613
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,840
Argentina great Diego Maradona has died at the age of 60.

614
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,720
There is no one like Maradona.

615
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,120
I have been crying since yesterday.

616
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
And so suddenly it’s like...

617
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,320
this is the blackest day in Argentinian history.

618
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,160
There’s people out on the streets weeping.

619
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,440
There is this horrendous grief

620
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,240
and this real public mourning.

621
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,640
Argentina’s reaction to losing the man who embodied them

622
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,320
was as emotional and chaotic as you’d expect.

623
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,960
The government realise they can’t contain this grief for Maradona

624
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,000
so essentially COVID regulations come to an end in Argentina

625
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,560
at that moment.

626
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,120
The moment of Maradona’s death.

627
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,480
Realising the gravity of the situation

628
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,120
the Argentinian government decree 3 days of national mourning.

629
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,800
And despite being in the height of lockdown

630
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,040
Maradona’s coffin is put on display in the presidential palace

631
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,720
where tens of thousands of mourners

632
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,880
come and pay their respects.

633
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,120
And in a fitting tribute to Maradona and football in the country

634
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,560
this brings out the best and worst in people.

635
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,160
Where fans from both sides of the country’s most notorious rivalries

636
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,480
unite in their grief.

637
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,320
Whilst riots and protests unfold when others can’t see the wake.

638
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,120
And so again a spiralling Argentina

639
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,800
looked for hope in it’s national team.

640
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,160
This time at the 2021 Copa America

641
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,840
the first international tournament Argentina would play

642
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,920
“post Diego’.

643
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,800
And you have to consider the fact that that Copa America

644
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,880
was supposed to be held in Argentina

645
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,680
and we were stripped away from it.

646
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,120
With the Copa America moved to Brazil due to Argentina’s

647
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,680
inability to cope with the tournament mid pandemic.

648
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,760
Messi and his squad were forced to spend six weeks in isolation

649
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,040
to try and finally end Argentina’s trophy drought.

650
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,720
They weren’t located in Brazil, they also had to

651
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,920
travel constantly from Argentina to Brazil and back again.

652
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,560
And they couldn’t see their family?

653
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,000
Exactly.

654
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,720
And yet in that adversity

655
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,480
I think that’s where Argentina really bond.

656
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,480
It’s where Messi really emerges as this vocal leader.

657
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,440
He became kind of this vocal leader, this motivational leader.

658
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,320
And you keep seeing him on the pitch talking to players in a way

659
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,720
he just hadn’t at previous World Cup’s and tournaments.

660
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,160
He’s, he’s a different leader.

661
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,920
And it’s fabulous to watch.

662
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,400
Messi leads Argentina all the way to another final

663
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,120
this time against hosts Brazil

664
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,280
where pre match shows the leader he’s become.

665
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,240
Yeah, that’s another Maradona moment.

666
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,040
And you also see I think, just how much the Argentinian players

667
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,000
wanted to win for him.

668
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,680
Dibu Martinez had said that

669
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,240
they weren’t winning a trophy with Messi

670
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,680
they were winning for Messi.

671
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,040
And that I think is a very unusual thing

672
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,200
for players to be desperate to win an international tournament

673
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,880
not just for themselves and for their country

674
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,960
but for a specific player.

675
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,720
And so as Argentina followed that speech out on to the pitch

676
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,880
and finally won their first trophy in nearly thirty years

677
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,640
in what was Messi’s fifth final with the national team.

678
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,280
It was no wonder the focus was on one player.

679
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,920
The best reflection of that you can possibly have is

680
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,280
when the final whistle blew

681
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,280
Messi drops to his knees...

682
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,240
and every other Argentinian player in that squad,

683
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,880
they don’t celebrate for themselves

684
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,960
they go and celebrate with Messi.

685
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,560
Finally Messi had brought a trophy back to Argentina.

686
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,240
But for the Argentinian football purists...

687
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,520
Nah Copa Americas don’t count.

688
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,520
I mean the Copa America

689
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,800
is clearly a major tournament.

690
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,520
However...

691
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,560
It is not the World Cup.

692
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,320
Obsessed.

693
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,080
Obsessed.

694
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,760
We are obsessed with the World Cup.

695
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,040
The World Cup is an obsession for Argentines.

696
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,200
For Argentinians...

697
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,240
success is the World Cup.

698
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,040
And that’s it.

699
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,040
It’s a country that needs to win a World Cup.

700
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,040
But Messi needs the World Cup.

701
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,240
“I DON’T WANT TO DIE NOT SEEING MESSI WIN A WORLD CUP”

702
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,680
Messi always said and repeated:

703
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,120
That he would exchange all his individual achievements,

704
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,600
all his Champions leagues

705
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,960
all his countless league titles

706
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,360
for it.

707
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,800
And so as the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar approached

708
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,120
with Messi now 35 years old.

709
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,600
Ahora O Nunca, now or never.

710
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,120
I mean this is the moment for him to do it.

711
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,360
Because he’s said it several times before

712
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,440
he’s not going to have another shot.

713
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,160
This is the last time he will ever try...

714
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,800
to win the World Cup for Argentina.

715
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,280
In Argentina’s first World Cup since Diego Maradona’s passing.

716
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,760
In Argentina’s first World Cup that was played during their summer.

717
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,040
In Argentina’s last World Cup with their, Messi-ah.

718
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,120
It all felt like the perfect time to end the nation’s 36 year wait

719
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,000
for their greatest obsession of all.

720
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,320
Argentina always have expectations at the World Cup.

721
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,760
But this time it was really justified.

722
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,000
This was not just a:

723
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,720
Look at the players we’ve got, we really should be winning this.

724
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,320
It was:

725
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,880
Look at the players we’ve got, and look how well we’re playing.

726
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,120
They boasted the most in form team in the world.

727
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,920
It’s 37...

728
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,000
games unbeaten.

729
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,600
Argentina had played Italy, the European champions

730
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,720
in the Finalissima.

731
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,520
And had beaten them very, very convincingly 3-0.

732
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,720
And they had the new “Maradonian” Messi.

733
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,600
The best player of his generation.

734
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,600
Possibly the best player in Argentina’s history.

735
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,280
The best player to ever play football.

736
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,240
And so with their first group stage game against Saudi Arabia

737
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,480
who were the worst ranked team in the World Cup.

738
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,360
The expectation wasn’t so much if they’d win

739
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,840
but by how much.

740
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,480
Yet somehow..

741
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,000
When we lost against Saudi Arabia, I was like: “That’s it”.

742
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,480
Really?

743
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,480
Yeah, I mean, how can you lose against Saudi Arabia?

744
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,680
So it’s a disaster for the country.

745
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,440
Yeah so the media reaction is...

746
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,640
You know it’s exactly what you’d expect.

747
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,360
Of course people freaked out after the result against Saudi Arabia.

748
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,680
This is a stain on world football.

749
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,400
That’s a very Argentinian thing.

750
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,960
The defeat was a kick in the teeth.

751
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,400
A result that no one in the world of football expected.

752
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,000
No one!

753
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,640
And there was this sort of slight sense of...

754
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,400
hang on, I’ve seen this from Argentina before.

755
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,240
Going to the World Cup as favourites

756
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,320
and flopping in the group stage?

757
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,640
For Argentina it felt like Déjà vu 20 years later...

758
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,320
People remembered 2002...

759
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,760
In which Argentina also came at a World Cup

760
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,280
in such a great form.

761
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,040
But they’re eliminated.

762
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,560
They don’t make it through to the knock outs.

763
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,560
And that was the big fear.

764
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,720
And so I think that Saudi Arabia game...

765
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,960
awoke all those ghosts again.

766
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,400
But it wasn’t only the World Cup

767
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,160
that was reminding Argentina of 2002...

768
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,760
Economic crisis, poverty and unemployment

769
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,760
are why thousands of Argentines took to the streets.

770
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,640
It’s always a tough moment for Argentina, but especially now.

771
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,280
50 per cent of the population is now living under the poverty line.

772
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,600
It’s very, very difficult for Argentinians to get by every day.

773
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,760
Because it wasn’t just Maradona’s passing

774
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,400
that had caused turmoil on the streets of Argentina.

775
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,000
There are several policies that have sent our economy into chaos.

776
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,440
And so similar to 2002...

777
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,400
2022 saw demonstrations and protests

778
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,520
once again become a daily part of Argentine life.

779
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,000
Yeah, I think there was a sense of Maradona’s death,

780
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,400
it was almost sort of the final straw.

781
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,520
That everything was going wrong.

782
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,440
The amount of families who are living without electricity right now.

783
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,640
The economy was in a mess, unemployment was rising,

784
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,720
inflation was rising.

785
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,680
It’s a country that at this point lives with inflation.

786
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,800
Inflation is running at 92 per cent year to year right now.

787
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,720
By the end of the year it’s about to reach:

788
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,080
100 per cent.

789
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,200
So you imagine what that does to your income?

790
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,840
The money that you earn in January...

791
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,200
is worth half

792
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,040
twelve months later.

793
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,960
And so more than ever, this World Cup

794
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,760
was about so much more than football.

795
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,720
For Argentines

796
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,360
this World Cup is more than just a distraction.

797
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,920
They need something to celebrate.

798
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,240
Something to believe.

799
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,760
Something to be hopeful about.

800
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,960
Yet one game in...

801
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,160
it already looked doomed.

802
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,200
So after the Saudi game, we couldn’t lose anymore.

803
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,440
One more loss and we were out.

804
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,240
They play Mexico next.

805
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,080
If we would have drawn against Mexico

806
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,680
we were out in the second game.

807
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,600
So, basically it was sudden death...

808
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,680
from that moment on.

809
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,440
And perhaps because of that

810
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,360
Argentina played even worse against Mexico.

811
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,240
When you see that first half against Mexico

812
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,840
they were all extremely feeling the pressure that

813
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,200
one wrong move and they would be out.

814
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,360
All the trauma they built up since 1990

815
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,800
all of that would have been weighing on them

816
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,560
even more heavily.

817
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,880
They were really nervous, they were shaking.

818
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,200
We’ve messed it up again.

819
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,320
We get to another World Cup and we’ve messed it up.

820
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,720
So Saudi Arabia wasn’t even the low point?

821
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,520
It was Half Time against Mexico?

822
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,520
Yes. We were drawing 0-0.

823
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,280
So if that game stays 0-0

824
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,760
Argentina would have been bottom of the group.

825
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,000
We still have 45 minutes.

826
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
But you need a miracle?

827
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,960
We needed a miracle.

828
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,360
And that miracle came through?

829
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,040
Who else?

830
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,320
And it’s Messi again!

831
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,240
It has to be Messi!

832
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,520
Who else!?!

833
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,680
It’s...

834
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,520
the perfect shot.

835
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,600
And the ball went exactly where it was supposed to go...

836
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,360
like right next to the post.

837
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,440
Someone as great a goalkeeper as Ochoa

838
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,600
could not reach that ball.

839
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,480
I mean what can I say man?

840
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,760
It’s like, it wasn’t that he just scored a regular goal.

841
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,040
It was another one from outside the box, from nothing.

842
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,640
Just like how they described Maradona in ‘86.

843
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,920
It’s a single moment

844
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,440
where like one player

845
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,960
has grabbed the tournament by the scruff of the neck

846
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,000
and won it.

847
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,560
Now, it was Messi’s turn.

848
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,800
That first goal by Messi was hit with such anger...

849
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,760
it was like a play by (Michael) Jordan or Diego,

850
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:58,000
in a way like he was our saviour.

851
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,920
And then that was it...

852
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,440
Argentina suddenly remembered how to play football again!

853
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,800
They remembered they had Messi, let’s be honest.

854
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,080
The Mexico win was followed by a 2-0 win over Poland

855
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,080
and that takes them to the knock stages

856
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,920
where they beat Australia in the Round of 16

857
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,160
thanks to another goal from...

858
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,840
And so with Argentina booking their place

859
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,800
in the quarter finals against the Dutch.

860
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,920
And only three games away from potential World Cup glory.

861
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,680
COPA90 & I decided to head out to “The Land Of Silver”

862
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,600
to experience firsthand

863
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,240
what could truly be

864
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,200
the ultimate Once In A Lifetime story...

865
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,520
Well a very warm welcome here to Buenos Aires

866
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,640
the time now has just gone 20 minutes past 10 in the morning.
