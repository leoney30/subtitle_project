1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,800
I’ve been working as a football journalist for 24 years

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,920
and I’ve covered all kinds of stories.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,560
But what happened on December 18th

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,520
is the greatest pure sports story

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,360
I’ve ever covered.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,960
My name’s Eli Mengem and for the past few years

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,480
I’ve been traversing Europe, documenting the tales

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,200
of football clubs and their fanbases

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,720
who’ve been on the verge of winning something

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,720
for the first time in a long time.

11
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,240
If not ever.

12
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,320
From Northern Turkey

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,640
to Southern Spain.

14
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,840
From South West Germany

15
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,120
to the Basque country.

16
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,600
I’ve been on a mission to show how important it is

17
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,640
that the game has a variety of winners

18
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,280
So that we learn about new places.

19
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,080
New people.

20
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,920
New cultures and most importantly

21
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,960
new stories.

22
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,600
Then came the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

23
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,240
Where I knew the exact “Once In A Lifetime” story I had to tell.

24
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,200
So as the world’s media descended on Qatar

25
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,280
to be at the tournament.

26
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,280
COPA90 and I decided to fly 8000 miles in the opposite direction

27
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,280
to tell the ultimate story of a football fanbase

28
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,480
on the brink of ending a 36 year wait

29
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,960
for the biggest prize in sport.

30
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,080
But what we found we found was a story that transcended football.

31
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,320
A story that reached into the very soul of a nation

32
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,080
that laid itself bare over two fateful weeks.

33
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,240
A story that etched a struggle for identity in a search for glory

34
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,240
that began over two centuries ago...

35
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,840
A story about Lionel Messi.

36
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,880
Argentina.

37
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,320
And 45 million people yearning to reclaim their place in history.

38
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,880
This is the all angle,

39
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,680
on the ground, as it happened

40
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,800
ultimate account

41
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,280
of perhaps the greatest football story of our time

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,360
Back in Buenos Aires, hungover but at least not jet-lagged

43
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,480
we’d returned to a city

44
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,280
basically running on World Cup hype.

45
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,000
Where all anyone was wearing...

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,120
All anyone was watching...

47
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,080
All anyone was reading...

48
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,680
Or all anyone was reading, whilst watching...

49
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,400
was World Cup related.

50
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,440
So to get a grasp of the situation, naturally

51
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,640
we obeyed the Cabalas

52
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,800
and started our World Cup Final countdown

53
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,440
by catching up with Santi

54
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,080
who wore the exact same shirt

55
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,520
and insisted on speaking in the exact same spot.

56
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,440
Welcome back to the bench!

57
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,840
The Cabalas bench!

58
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,960
One more!

59
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,680
For the third and final time! Yes!

60
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,320
And whilst there was a lot to talk about

61
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,720
there was one particular subject we had to start with.

62
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,080
It’s funny we came here obviously to tell this story

63
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,560
“Once In A Lifetime” hoping, but...

64
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,040
I didn’t think there was anyway we could have had this many

65
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,800
magical Messi moments in particular.

66
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,000
Magical Messi moments.

67
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,160
He is equal top goalscorer

68
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,200
Most assists.

69
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,320
Most chances created.

70
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,560
Most dribbles.

71
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,520
Everyones been talking about how he needs a tournament

72
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,440
where he grabs the...

73
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,560
World Cup by the scruff of it’s neck...

74
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,400
like Diego did.

75
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,640
And he’s achieving all this at the age of 35.

76
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,080
You can’t forget about that.

77
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,800
But, no one was forgetting.

78
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,120
With even the notoriously demanding Argentinian media

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,200
gushing in their praise.

80
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,000
“THIS MESSI HAS ME FASCINATEDHOW COULD I CRITICISE HIM?”

81
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,520
Best summed up by the words of reporter Sofia Martinez

82
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,320
who chose not to ask Messi something,

83
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,040
but tell him.

84
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,480
The World Cup Final is coming

85
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,080
and although we'd all like to win it,

86
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,240
I just wanted to tell you that whatever the result is…..

87
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,160
there is something that no one can ever take away from you.

88
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,800
You have touched every single Argentinian.

89
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,760
I mean it when I say that.

90
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,720
And so with even the media caught up in the Messi lovefest

91
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,320
I caught up with journalist Joel Richards to find out more.

92
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,560
I thought it was really moving and really touching

93
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,520
I thought, she said what everyone was thinking.

94
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,160
I mean he is the one who is making us all dream...

95
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,280
who is getting us so optimistic and hopeful.

96
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,440
And in every walk of life, in every social interaction,

97
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,800
people are lighter on their feet,

98
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,600
they’re happier, they’re smiling.

99
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,280
And that’s not something that always comes hand in hand with Argentines.

100
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,400
That’s not the stereotype.

101
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,520
You see the ubiquitous optimism we were coming across

102
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,360
wasn’t exactly typical of modern Argentinian life.

103
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,680
You’ve only been here in Argentina for a week.

104
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,080
You might think people celebrating, chanting, being happy

105
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,960
this is normal.

106
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,000
It’s not normal. You know what’s normal?

107
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,480
Political turmoil is normal.

108
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,360
The country’s Vice President was threatened with a gun.

109
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,760
Inflation is normal.

110
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,520
People in Argentina are struggling

111
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,800
with one of the highest inflation rates in the world.

112
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,440
But then the World Cup comes around, Messi shines

113
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,040
and now you’ve got people standing on top of rooftops and buses.

114
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,800
Each day a new viral video came out documenting

115
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,240
the unbelievable World Cup effect on the country.

116
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,040
From the goal reactions in the airport and on Argentinian flights.

117
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:39,680
To those suffering from Argentina’s constant power outages.

118
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:47,000
Who were then forced to listen outside on car radios.

119
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,640
It turned out the combination of Argentinian passion and emotions

120
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,160
with long summer days

121
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,320
and a deep, dramatic World Cup run

122
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,160
was the perfect recipe for a never ending cycle of mad moments.

123
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,760
From heartwarming scenes of generosity

124
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,160
to bizarre moments of anarchy

125
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,520
to hilarious acts of passionate stupidity.

126
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,240
What has he done?

127
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,360
But nothing embodied the magic unfolding

128
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,240
as much as the ‘Abuela’ (Grandma) phenomenon.

129
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,120
Which all began when 76 year old Maria Cristina

130
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,800
joined a post match celebration to the cries of:

131
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,600
And so all across the nation any woman of a particular age

132
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,560
found themselves being serenaded with:

133
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,720
In Rosario, they went to Messi’s grandmothers place.

134
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,280
His old Grandmother’s place!

135
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,960
Just to sing about the fact that she’s the grandmother of Messi.

136
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,720
This World Cup has not just been a distraction for people.

137
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,080
It’s transformed Argentine society.

138
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,560
You’ve got people hanging from traffic lights.

139
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,520
You’ve got the elderly kissing on the streets.

140
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,560
People are happier, it’s that simple.

141
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,440
There was a fight that was broken up

142
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,600
because the two people who were fighting were reminded

143
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,960
that Argentina had won

144
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,440
and had qualified for the final of the World Cup!

145
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:20,600
and had qualified for the final of the World Cup!
"What are you fighting about? We're in the final!”

146
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,960
"What are you fighting about? We're in the final!”

147
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,720
I mean this is not normal in Argentina!

148
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,160
This is not normal!

149
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,680
Spontaneous acts of generosity, happiness

150
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,520
that just aren’t things that people are used to hearing about.

151
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,880
There was an old man he was watching the game on the TV

152
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,640
from outside the store.

153
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,960
And now the store has bought the TV for that old man.

154
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,520
A wealthy Argentine bought Maradona’s old house.

155
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,840
That man, has since, on match days, opened up his house...

156
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,160
put on a barbecue and just let the house fill up with supporters

157
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,800
who want to go and be in the place where Maradona lived

158
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,080
to watch the game.

159
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,680
And that’s just unthinkable, opening up your house to strangers

160
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,080
that’s unthinkable in Argentina...

161
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,400
And so many people have been saying

162
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,800
If only we could take this week...

163
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,360
and just make it last.

164
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,120
Because everyone’s demeanour,

165
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,920
the way they go about their daily life,

166
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,200
the way they are at home,

167
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,160
the way parents are with their children...

168
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,760
has been transformed by Argentina

169
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,640
reaching the final of the World Cup.

170
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,000
Because this Sunday

171
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,840
we’re playing at a World Cup Final for the first time in 8 years.

172
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,480
With a chance of winning it for the first time in 36!

173
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,640
It's the only joy we can aspire to.

174
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,400
The only one

175
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,600
The mood around Argentines has been at an all time low.

176
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,880
We’ve been dealt blow after blow after blow.

177
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,040
We’ve been dealt blow after blow after blow.
Historically we've been so screwed by so many governments and...

178
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:49,960
Historically we've been so screwed by so many governments and...

179
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,320
and well, it's the joy of the people.

180
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,840
It's football.

181
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,480
An evasion that allows us some momentary happiness.

182
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,320
You're crying?

183
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,760
I get emotional when I talk about Argentina.

184
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,480
But he wasn’t the only one getting emotional

185
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,480
at the significance of what it all meant.

186
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,160
As eventually it even began to dawn on me just what we were a part of.

187
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,360
This is all getting too much for me now.

188
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,600
No more so than when speaking to Maia

189
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,240
who put it all into context so succinctly.

190
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,360
who put it all into context so succinctly.
Our country is going through a complex socio political situation.

191
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,400
Our country is going through a complex socio political situation.

192
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,080
Yet people are only thinking about winning the World-Cup.

193
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,160
We don't care about anything else.

194
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,960
People go out to celebrate like they weren't going hungry.

195
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,280
Like they don't have work problems.

196
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,600
Like our only concern was to...

197
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,520
celebrate.

198
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,720
72 hours until the big final

199
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,040
and Argentina had their opponents confirmed.

200
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,040
The Kylian Mbappe led France.

201
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,560
Who were the current World champions

202
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,440
and the nation who kicked Argentina out of the last World Cup.

203
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,440
But whoever we caught up with didn’t seem phased.

204
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,720
Who cares about Mbappe.

205
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,760
We’ve got Messi.

206
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:01,920
We’ve got Messi.
He makes the whole team play.

207
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,760
He makes the whole team play.

208
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,120
Not only has he scored five goals

209
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,360
and done three assists

210
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,800
he’s become like a manager inside the pitch

211
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,200
for his teammates.

212
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,080
But this confidence felt deeper than just a belief in Messi.

213
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,000
Like we say, the planets are aligning for everything to...

214
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,560
become one.

215
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:23,720
become one.
Many people are talking about...

216
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,280
Many people are talking about...

217
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,800
the coincidences between this World Cup and the one from '86.

218
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,240
There is something curious about it

219
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,520
when Argentina won in ‘86...

220
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,280
he was 17 years old.

221
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,920
Right now I am 17 years old.

222
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,080
Right now I am 17 years old.
The referee for the final was born on the same day as…..

223
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,280
The referee for the final was born on the same day as…..

224
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,760
different year, but same day as the referee from the '86 final.

225
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,720
And so it came as no surprise

226
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,840
the country’s most popular World Cup commercial

227
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,120
was based around the subject.

228
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,280
was based around the subject.
FOR THOSE WHO NEED COINCIDENCES

229
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,160
FOR THOSE WHO NEED COINCIDENCES

230
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,240
THERE ARE COINCIDENCES

231
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,960
The final of the 1986 World Cup was played at midday..

232
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,240
and the final in Qatar kicks off at midday!

233
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,520
Once again with the coincidences?

234
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,360
Yet for all the talk of fate their superstitious ways continued.

235
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,480
As I learnt from Vanessa

236
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,440
a UK born daughter of an Argentinian

237
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,320
who moved to the country 15 years ago.

238
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,600
Like, all these white witches

239
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,960
they’re casting spells,

240
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,320
they’re like writing symbolic numbers

241
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,360
and putting them in the freezers.

242
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,800
They’re burying things in the garden.

243
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:19,960
They’re burying things in the garden.
“La Brujinetas” are a group of witches from Argentina

244
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,160
“La Brujinetas” are a group of witches from Argentina

245
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,520
and what they do is 'spiritually' help the national team.

246
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,640
It’s like white magic.

247
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:28,800
It’s like white magic.
A group of witches have got together online

248
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,920
A group of witches have got together online

249
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,600
that send the team positive energy.

250
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,120
And you're probably asking really?

251
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,160
Yes, really!

252
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,600
In fact even I had created my own Cabalas superstition.

253
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,720
Too scared to shave my beard in fear of affecting the result.

254
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,800
The worst part is it’s Summer so it gets extra itchy

255
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,720
and extra sweaty

256
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
not that you need the details, but...

257
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,800
honestly the things I’m doing just to get this team over the line.

258
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,600
Another day closer to the final

259
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,160
meant another day of hysterical World Cup moments.

260
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,040
You think it can’t get crazier

261
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,240
and it does.

262
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,160
They’ve just announced they’ve renamed streets in Mar Del Plata

263
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,080
after Leo Messi and Scaloni.

264
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,760
You talk about what this means...

265
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,000
They haven’t even won it yet.

266
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,920
Meanwhile I finally came across the reason

267
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,360
we’d come across so many Bangladeshi flags.

268
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:12,520
we’d come across so many Bangladeshi flags.
Bangladesh has been rooting for Argentina since 1986.

269
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,560
Bangladesh has been rooting for Argentina since 1986.

270
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,920
Ever since Maradona scored that goal against the English,

271
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,080
the Hand of God.

272
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,600
From that day, the people of Bangladesh

273
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,440
which for many years was an English colony.

274
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,680
beat a nation as powerful as England,

275
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,440
they fell in love with Argentinian football and Maradona.

276
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,920
And so due to this connection

277
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,800
Argentina’s World Cup run to the final

278
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,560
was creating scenes in Bangladesh

279
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,000
that even impressed the Argentinians.

280
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,160
that even impressed the Argentinians.
The craziest thing was the flag.

281
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,280
The craziest thing was the flag.

282
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,960
A 10 km long flag that covered an entire city.

283
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,880
It cost them like 30,000 dollars.

284
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,360
The thing was gargantuan, crazy.

285
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,080
Then there were the match day scenes.

286
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,240
Then there were the match day scenes.
Over 100,000 people gathering to encourage our national team.

287
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,080
Over 100,000 people gathering to encourage our national team.

288
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,640
Big screens, sometimes in the middle of the night.

289
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,080
They don't sleep; they celebrate until 5 or 6 am.

290
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,720
It's madness, and we fell in love with that.

291
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:07,800
And we want to offer them this humble homage.

292
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,680
We had reached the eve of the Final.

293
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,000
Where a noticeable change of mood was in the air

294
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,880
as the confidence of the past few days

295
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,560
seemed to be enveloped by the thought of a loss.

296
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:17,720
seemed to be enveloped by the thought of a loss.
Exactly, this match for Argentina, due to the passion of the people,

297
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,400
Exactly, this match for Argentina, due to the passion of the people,

298
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,840
they just can't lose it.

299
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,600
It means too much for them.

300
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,880
I think it's the most important game Argentina's ever played.

301
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,920
Really?

302
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,120
More so than the '86 final?

303
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,880
More, because...

304
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,520
Yes, because the team was so strong with Maradona.

305
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,960
With this in mind, I decided to head to the stadium

306
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,640
of Argentinos Juniors.

307
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,280
The club where Maradona’s career began

308
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,000
and where I’d been told a shrine to Diego had been set up

309
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,920
since he had passed away.

310
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,600
And it’s here I met Gaston

311
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,920
whose words and demeanour

312
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,200
embodied the anxiety of the entire country.

313
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,360
embodied the anxiety of the entire country.
Is this tournament now or never for Argentina?

314
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,120
Is this tournament now or never for Argentina?

315
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,000
Of course.

316
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,120
Yes, because Messi may never play again.

317
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,040
On the verge of tears the entire time we spoke

318
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,480
Gaston had come to the shrine to pray

319
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,200
to the man who had last won the country a World Cup.

320
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,360
to the man who had last won the country a World Cup.
I came here today because of tomorrow's game.

321
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,480
I came here today because of tomorrow's game.

322
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,040
We believe that he's somehow looking down

323
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,680
and guiding our national team.

324
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,320
And it wasn’t long before more people arrived to do the same.

325
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:29,440
And it wasn’t long before more people arrived to do the same.
Are you here about tomorrow?

326
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,960
Are you here about tomorrow?

327
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,640
Obviously!

328
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,640
I'm here asking Diego to let us take the cup tomorrow.

329
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,080
love being Argentinian. I love my country!

330
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,160
We're here asking God.

331
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,160
Our God. Our football God.

332
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,320
We are asking for everyone,

333
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,120
for our country, our people, for everyone.

334
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,440
To be champions.

335
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,840
We want people to be happy.

336
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,240
We Argentinians, we have a saying

337
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,760
“Whatever it takes, we have to win tomorrow.”

338
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,520
And so after 9 long days.

339
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,280
Containing 2 dramatic matches.

340
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,840
In 2 intense cities.

341
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,480
With dozens of interviews

342
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,600
from dozens of perspectives.

343
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,920
As the sun began to set on the eve of the final

344
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,040
I felt we had a pretty clear perspective

345
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,120
of this World Cup in this country.

346
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,000
But I had still had one particularly important interview to conduct

347
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,360
with my old friend, Izzy.

348
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,280
Who’d been part of all my previous films in Argentina.

349
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,040
Where he’d always been his unapologetically Argentine self.

350
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,440
And this time was no different.

351
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,920
Eli: You look better than ever, unlike me.

352
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,520
Izzy: l can't say the same but... Eli: Argentinians huh.

353
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Izzy: I wouldn't lie.

354
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,320
When I’d first interviewed Izzy back in 2017

355
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,000
the mere mention of Maradona had him waxing lyrical.

356
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,200
Maradona is different, you know?

357
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,960
It’s him against all odds.

358
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,960
It’s him playing miracles.

359
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,440
It’s like we’re on the verge of dying.

360
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
And he resurrects us.

361
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,640
Like Jesus Christ.

362
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,640
Put it like that.

363
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,120
But, when asked about Messi...

364
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,640
If he’s the best player in the world for Barcelona

365
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,880
and never delivers for us.

366
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,000
It’s the same as nothing.

367
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,160
We’re better not having him.

368
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,560
Now half a decade later, with the new Maradonian Messi

369
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,960
having brought Argentina a Copa America

370
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,560
and another World Cup final.

371
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,200
I was curious to hear if Izzy

372
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,000
and his father Marcos

373
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,600
who’d supported the team at 6 World Cups around the world...

374
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,480
Felt any differently the day before Messi could finally deliver

375
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,760
what they’d been waiting 36 years for...

376
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,640
and I got my answer straight away.

377
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,440
There’s no achievement in reaching the final.

378
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,280
The silver medal doesn’t count for anything.

379
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,600
Now, initially, they tried to claim the criticism

380
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,560
wasn’t reflective of themselves.

381
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,920
I’m not saying it’s right

382
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,720
but unfortunately

383
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,880
knowing my countrymen, if he doesn’t win tomorrow

384
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,800
things are going to go pretty south for him.

385
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,520
But, whenever the question came up

386
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,600
of whether Messi had done enough for Argentina

387
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,920
regardless of the result in the final.

388
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,040
regardless of the result in the final.
If he wins, if he wins...

389
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,320
If he wins, if he wins...

390
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,240
- If he loses?

391
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,840
It’s going to be just ahh remember Messi...

392
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,600
He's a loser', if he loses he's a loser'.

393
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,640
Nothing he has done before matters.

394
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,880
It's all about tomorrow.

395
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,280
We’re like bad parents.

396
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,360
Deep inside we love him but...

397
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,200
he needs to win!

398
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,720
He needs to win you know.

399
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,440
That’s it.

400
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,400
You’re so harsh.

401
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,240
If he wins...

402
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,240
Will you be equally as appreciative?

403
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,800
If he wins...

404
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,960
Messi’s my idol.

405
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,840
I will put a flag there that says:

406
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,800
“I’m sorry Messi”

407
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,360
But!

408
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,200
If he doesn’t win...

409
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,000
I can’t say on camera what the flag is going to say.

410
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,320
And if you thought that was harsh.

411
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:31,440
And if you thought that was harsh.
Tomorrow will define the story of Messi.

412
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,040
Tomorrow will define the story of Messi.

413
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,800
If he wins tomorrow, he's a hero.

414
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,320
If he loses...

415
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,560
If tomorrow they win!

416
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,160
It’s Saint Messi.

417
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:46,920
If he lost!

418
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,000
You’re a fucking failure and go back to Spain!

419
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,080
And whilst things got a little too heated.

420
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,760
When we did get back on track...

421
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,120
It was my turn to rant.

422
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,720
I disagree.

423
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,840
Did you not see the interview with the journalist after the match?

424
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,360
Where she told him:

425
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,720
I don’t want to ask you a question, I want to tell you something

426
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,880
We want to thank you

427
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,240
for making us dream again.

428
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,000
For making us hope again.

429
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,280
It doesn’t matter the final result.

430
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,920
Yeah but the dream, could turn into a nightmare if we lose.

431
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,720
No but she said! She specifically said, the result...

432
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,560
She specifically said the result doesn’t matter.

433
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,720
And she was speaking on behalf of the whole country?

434
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,360
Yeah...

435
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:16,960
Why?

436
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,240
Or maybe, she was speaking on behalf of...

437
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,000
of a generation or two.

438
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,040
A different generation to you guys.

439
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,040
A generation who didn’t get to see Maradona’s wonders, but

440
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,920
what Messi’s given them is...

441
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,880
as close as possible to someone who has

442
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,640
become a god, a deity,

443
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,240
is another unattainable Argentinian dream.

444
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,520
Maybe, you need to relax that

445
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,320
and forget it and let it go...

446
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,800
and go, you got to see something beautiful.

447
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,760
But this tournament...

448
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,120
Yes this tournament is different.

449
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,240
Yes.

450
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,280
He’s shown the fight.

451
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,600
He’s argued with refs.

452
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,080
He’s argued with players.

453
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,240
He’s remonstrated against coaches.

454
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,080
He’s done it all!

455
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,720
Yeah, but he has one last thing to do.

456
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,440
To win.

457
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,000
Tomorrow.

458
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,080
Alright, well, here we go.

459
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,120
The sun rises on arguably Argentina’s most important,

460
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,280
most significant day...

461
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,480
this century maybe?

462
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,360
I’m not just talking about in a sporting context.

463
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,560
I’m talking about in general.

464
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,840
I know Argentina has gone through a lot...

465
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,800
A lot lately.

466
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,480
I’ve heard a lot in the past, but...

467
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,520
You know, everyone you speak to

468
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,320
whether they’re young, old...

469
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,480
rich, poor...

470
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,200
Everyone says the same thing.

471
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,600
They’ve never felt such a dramatic shift

472
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
in the mood of society.

473
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,440
And it’s all been leading up to this!

474
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,120
It’s funny, you know I always get emotionally caught up in

475
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,400
whichever story I’m telling.

476
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,320
Wherever it is in the world.

477
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,040
But I don’t think I’ve ever been as emotionally involved

478
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,840
as I have, here.

479
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,600
This time.

480
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,320
I haven’t shaved because of Cabalas.

481
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,960
I haven’t slept because of nerves.

482
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,880
The other day interviewing Maia...

483
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,520
I started crying two questions into her answers and

484
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,360
whilst yes her words were poetic, beautiful,

485
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,880
there was something deeper you know?

486
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,400
I’ve really started to realise what was at stake here.

487
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,160
I’ve really started to realise how this might be...

488
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,800
not just the football story of the year...

489
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,480
This might be the footballing story of the decade.

490
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,880
That’s extreme but...

491
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,960
You gotta look at it like this:

492
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,200
I didn’t grow up with this game.

493
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,960
I found it in my teens when I started seeing how

494
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,920
it entrenched itself

495
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,280
into a person’s soul.

496
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,120
Into a community.

497
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,800
Into a country like no other sport...

498
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,400
Like, no other anything...

499
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,280
could.

500
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,360
And I feel like Argentinians

501
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,080
whether its because of their

502
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,560
extroverted ways,

503
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,360
because of their obsessive personality.

504
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,800
Because of their...

505
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,400
innate desire to

506
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,360
want to realise glorious, unattainable

507
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,840
realistically unachievable dreams...

508
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,520
They may be, more than Brazil,

509
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,360
maybe even more than England...

510
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,080
the most passionate football nation.

511
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,400
At least when it comes to this tournament

512
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,240
and it comes to their national team

513
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,120
and their number tens.

514
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,200
You know in his book about football and his time spent here

515
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,120
Jonathan Wilson said that:

516
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,800
He doesn’t believe that there’s a country on earth

517
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,200
that romanticizes or intellectualises the game

518
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,440
like the Argentinians do.

519
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,800
And he’s right, it’s true.

520
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,400
But, for me I think it’s more than that.

521
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,000
It’s the way they

522
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,720
use football to express themselves.

523
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,600
Through song,

524
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,080
through hand gestures

525
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,320
to the way they bounce.

526
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,920
It’s the way they incorporate it

527
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,600
into their social and political movements.

528
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,120
It’s the way they...

529
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,440
cling on to football to give them...

530
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,440
hope.

531
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,200
When hope seems...

532
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,760
So far away here.

533
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,720
And so with all of that in mind...

534
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,160
I just can’t help thinking

535
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,720
how does Argentina...

536
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,160
At least in my opinion, the most,

537
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,160
football and World Cup obsessed nation on earth

538
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,680
deal with this?

539
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,400
And so as kick off approached

540
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,520
and the streets of Buenos Aires emptied.

541
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,600
Once again our crew split up

542
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,720
to try and document the fixture

543
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,000
amongst a variety of different people, places and perspectives.

544
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,400
One camera headed to the city fan zone

545
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,200
already at capacity hours before kick off.

546
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,920
One camera headed to a family home

547
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,280
that of Izzy and his father Marcos.

548
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,640
We found one Argentinian cameraman

549
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,240
willing to film for half of the match with Gaston.

550
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,840
The supporter I’d met at the Maradona shrine.

551
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,800
And as for me, and my cameraman Igal

552
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,840
we were determined to capture the essence

553
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,240
of the streets of Buenos Aires

554
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,000
on the day of Argentina’s only ever

555
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,720
World Cup final in their Summer.

556
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,560
And so after a long time searching, I found Ronaldo.

557
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,120
The only cab driver willing to work during the match

558
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,840
and that was only because he was Venezuelan,

559
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,120
and we’d offered him nearly a months salary.

560
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,800
And so together we roamed the deserted streets of the capital

561
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,240
visiting the small businesses that couldn’t afford to shut

562
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,840
even though the government announced it was a public holiday.

563
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,920
From bakeries

564
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,840
to butchers.

565
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,760
From cafes.

566
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,760
To kiosks.

567
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,600
And though our strategy didn’t get off to the best start

568
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,600
thanks to a very Argentinian reason...

569
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,040
That’s amazing!

570
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,680
So, we wanted to watch it with the people

571
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,080
but they don’t want to watch it with me!

572
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,480
Because I might be Cabalas.

573
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,800
Luckily, we found a grocery store, willing to accommodate us

574
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,680
just in time for kick off.

575
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,120
I mean we’re 90 minutes away man.

576
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,040
I can’t believe I’m saying that.

577
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,840
We’re 90 minutes away.

578
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,800
90 minutes away from...

579
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,760
I mean I’ve heard stories my whole life

580
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,680
of my parents talking about ‘78, Kempes.

581
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,400
‘86, Maradona.

582
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,920
And I’ve been fed those stories constantly whilst never quite...

583
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,440
watching it for myself.

584
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,560
And now, I finally, finally have that chance.

585
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,120
We’re only one game away.

586
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,440
One game away from finally creating my own stories

587
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,120
of Argentina winning the World Cup.

588
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,600
Do you understand that?

589
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,960
And so we were off.

590
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,680
The 2022 FIFA World Cup Final had begun.

591
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,680
And the entire nation was strapped in

592
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,840
for one final ride on the emotional rollercoaster that is

593
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,160
supporting this nation at this tournament.

594
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,720
And whilst France may have been the best team in the world

595
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,960
it was Argentina who began with all the chances.

596
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,560
The only problem being...

597
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,160
they weren’t taking any of them.

598
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,800
Meanwhile I was back on the road looking

599
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,280
to find other people and places to watch

600
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:02,000
to get as broad a perspective as possible on such a unique day.

601
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,760
Yet no matter the person.

602
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,880
No matter the place.

603
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,240
It was the same talking point it had been all week.

604
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,920
Messi.

605
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,080
Messi.
The entire country is on Messi's shoulders right now.

606
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,720
The entire country is on Messi's shoulders right now.

607
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,400
Even politicians aren't under as much pressure as Messi.

608
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,680
This is the key moment for Messi to consecrate himself,

609
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,840
because he's close to the end of his career,

610
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,720
to become the best player in the world.

611
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,480
But Messi needs the World Cup.

612
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,240
Argentina's story with Messi depends on tomorrow's game.

613
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,360
If he wins, he'll be put up there on a throne

614
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,360
If he loses, he'll be placed under ground.

615
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,400
He has to win tomorrow.

616
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:47,560
He has to win tomorrow.
Journalists will destroy him if they don't win tomorrow.

617
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,280
Journalists will destroy him if they don't win tomorrow.

618
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,400
Our society as well.

619
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:56,040
Because, so far, he hasn't been able to compete with Maradona.

620
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,160
What would he have to do to reach Maradona’s level?

621
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,880
To be in the same conversation?

622
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,040
At least win the World Cup.

623
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,520
He’s 90 minutes away.

624
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,160
And be part of it.

625
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,280
Not like Ronaldo in the Euro 2016.

626
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,760
Score the goal.

627
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,680
Penalty Argentina.

628
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,960
21 minutes in.

629
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,840
This is actually happening.

630
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,120
Who takes the penalty?

631
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,800
Even our cab driver, Ronaldo.

632
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,400
Get in here.

633
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,960
Messi is a penalty kick away

634
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,080
from doing what even Maradona couldn’t do.

635
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,120
Scoring in a final.

636
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,760
Show us why you’re the best in the world.

637
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,440
Let’s go outside.

638
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,440
Listen.

639
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,800
They say when you go to Argentina...

640
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,760
Look at that!

641
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,960
Look at that!

642
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,720
Argentina are in front.

643
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,240
Messi has scored in a World Cup final.

644
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,600
Look what it means.

645
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,120
Look what it means.

646
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,080
He’s actually done it.

647
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,040
People are on the street.

648
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,480
It’s actually f**king happening!

649
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,960
Now, whether it was the sunstroke or the orchestra of balcony roars.

650
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,640
It’s fair to say I’d lost my head

651
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,640
and was completely swept up in the occasion

652
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,080
high fiving traffic and hugging strangers on the street

653
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,240
but eventually I did remember there was still the vast majority

654
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,320
of the game still to be played.

655
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,520
And so we entered our fifth location of the day

656
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,160
where we had just enough time for a quick dance

657
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,680
and a quick drink to calm down

658
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,480
before Argentina were on the attack once again.

659
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,280
And whilst it’s evident I lost my head once again

660
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,720
in all fairness...

661
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,680
So had everyone else...

662
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,800
As children.

663
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,640
Teenagers.

664
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,960
And even grown adults

665
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,360
all seemed overcome with all kinds of emotions.

666
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,720
As one by one it seemed to dawn on everyone

667
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,680
that Argentina might really be winning a World Cup again.

668
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,880
To the streets! To the streets!

669
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,040
And as incredible as it was being amongst the chaos indoors

670
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,880
I was desperate once again to experience that roar of the streets

671
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,920
that only a Buenos Aires World Cup match day can provide.

672
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,240
Where are you going?

673
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:55,960
The Obelisco!

674
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,720
The Obelisco right now?!?

675
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,680
But it isn't over yet?

676
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,720
They’re already going to the Obelisk!

677
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,760
Never before had a halftime felt as needed for the players

678
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,720
as it did the supporters,

679
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,800
myself included.

680
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,240
As already everyone seemed to be already emotionally exhausted.

681
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,320
As already everyone seemed to be already emotionally exhausted.
This country runs on football, on passion, the things we love.

682
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,560
This country runs on football, on passion, the things we love.

683
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,080
Football is one of the things we most love.

684
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,880
The team's strength and the strength of 45 million Argentinians.

685
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,360
Argentinians who can't eat and can't sleep.

686
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,880
Can't think of anything else.

687
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,320
It's the last one we want. The last one we need.

688
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,880
And it's the last one he (Messi) deserves.

689
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,360
Because not only does he deserve it.

690
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,120
We all deserve it,

691
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,480
because of all we've resisted, and all we've endured.

692
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,840
It's all that we ask.

693
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,000
It's all we ask. All we ask God.

694
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,800
We don't ask him for anything else.

695
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,040
We may be having a rough time, going hungry...

696
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,080
but this is all we ask for.

697
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,840
Not a thing more.

698
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,760
For us, for just one more World Cup, to be on top again...

699
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,320
seeing Messi raise the World Cup...

700
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,440
could change this country.

701
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,240
And so the Second Half began

702
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,720
with the country in the best mood

703
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,200
I had ever seen it.

704
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,840
As the final forty five minutes

705
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,560
were being counted down with an energy and an enthusiasm

706
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,680
that could only be described as a collective shedding

707
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,880
of the 36 years worth of hurt and heartbreak

708
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,080
that this country had attached to the tournament.

709
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,080
And so as we slowly made our way deeper into the city.

710
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,040
I started noticing that the roads and footpaths were a lot busier

711
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,520
than the first half.

712
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,680
So naturally I had to find out more.

713
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,000
For some it was just another case of Argentine superstition.

714
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,240
Why aren't you viewing the game in your house?

715
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,600
It's cábala, my brother.

716
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,880
This is win or win.

717
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,280
In whatever way, but we win.

718
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,320
I was watching the game (at home)

719
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,960
and I went out to buy candles...

720
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,160
I'm going to drive around. I go in circles.

721
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,000
I'm going to shout and I'm going to honk my horn.

722
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,840
Candles... to burn.

723
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,240
To burn for good energy.

724
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,360
Igal: Have you watched the whole match in your car?

725
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,400
- Yes!

726
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,440
And then I saw this (Screen) and i decided to stay

727
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,200
It's my way.

728
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,520
And I get too nervous watching.

729
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,160
Because of the cábalas?

730
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,080
Yeah, cábalas.

731
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,680
For cábalas

732
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,120
For others, it was just a case sheer optimism.

733
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,160
For others, it was just a case sheer optimism.
Igal: Why are you in your car? Not watching the game?

734
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,120
Igal: Why are you in your car? Not watching the game?

735
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,800
Because we're heading to the Obelisco, where everyone is.

736
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,880
The fans! The people!

737
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,320
Obelisco! Right now?

738
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,720
Igal: But it's not over!

739
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,330
Not yet!

740
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,120
Regardless!

741
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,200
Come on! The third goal is coming!

742
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,640
This is actually insane.

743
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,760
There is so many more cars on the street than I thought.

744
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,840
You know and it turns out everyone is going to the Obelisco early.

745
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,240
There’s still half an hour left.

746
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,200
Yeah, yeah, get excited.

747
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,400
You’re half an hour away from ending this 36 year drought.

748
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,240
But you’re still Argentina.

749
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,880
You can still suffer!

750
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,600
It was only a few games ago...

751
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,280
That Dutch match.

752
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,640
Let’s not get too cocky.

753
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,240
15 minutes to get to the '90.

754
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,480
And so we were off to our next location.

755
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,920
Where that reserved anticipation I was hoping for

756
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,520
was nowhere to be seen.

757
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,320
And it was the same in the fan zone

758
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,160
where with just over ten minutes to go

759
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,800
the finish line was in sight and being celebrated accordingly.

760
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,080
In fact the only corner of the country

761
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,600
that didn’t seem swept up in a similar euphoria

762
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,040
was Izzy’s house.

763
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,840
And whether that was down to their experience or their cynicism

764
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,200
turns out they were right to be cautious.

765
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,400
Fu**ing clear it!

766
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,960
I told you!

767
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,280
A penalty?

768
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,160
Yeah for them.

769
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,120
For... them?

770
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,080
And whilst I couldn’t get a clear sight at the screen

771
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,440
to see what was going on...

772
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,120
I think it’s a penalty to France.

773
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,440
They're singing (for goalkeeper) Dibu...

774
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,720
Mbappé was already lining up the spot kick.

775
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,000
Mbappé scores.

776
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,600
France score. 2-1

777
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,560
I told you, I told you.

778
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,440
These guys...

779
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,640
Only know how to suffer.

780
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,840
Oh no, now this...

781
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,040
Now begins the stress.

782
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,120
But, before the anxiety could even kick in.

783
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,040
Before the prayers could even be answered.

784
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,680
Before the worst case scenario could even be imagined.

785
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,720
Izzy: I cān't live football like this!

786
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,080
After leading the match

787
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,720
for 57 minutes

788
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,520
including a two goal lead

789
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,120
for 45 minutes.

790
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,760
With only ten minutes left

791
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,400
Argentina had given it all up

792
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,840
within the space of 97 seconds.

793
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,760
And so as the hands of happiness in the air

794
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,000
were replaced with hands of heartbreak on heads.

795
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,520
I was now starting to realise

796
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,160
there was actually quite a lot of sense

797
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,800
In Izzy’s cynicism.

798
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,840
You’re right. (A World Cup Final) is a dream.

799
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,880
But a nightmare is a type of dream too you know?

800
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,520
And losing the World Cup, in the Final.

801
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,480
It’s a fu**ing nightmare.

802
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,760
It’s getting so close.

803
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,920
So close.

804
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,400
I much prefer, like, losing Quarter Finals.

805
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,520
And so as we moved on to our next location.

806
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,480
Where the mood was neither warm nor welcoming...

807
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,560
Because we think we could win.

808
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,120
But if that doesn’t happen...

809
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,040
Everything goes away.

810
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,480
All the love will go away.

811
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,880
Minute by minute Izzy’s predictions played out...

812
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,400
This country and football...

813
00:34:43,825 --> 00:34:45,080
What's up man? What's up?

814
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,840
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

815
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,000
We’re not saying that we personally feel like that.

816
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,120
We’re just saying that knowing our country.

817
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,920
And knowing our people.

818
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,920
If he doesn’t win tomorrow...

819
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,160
This is what’s going to happen.

820
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,480
Again he was right...

821
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,560
As we began seeing Argentinians threatening

822
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,160
and turning on each other.

823
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,320
And so as we moved away for our own safety

824
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:15,560
Once again it was Izzy’s words, this time from our chat in 2017

825
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,480
that rang true.

826
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,600
I’ll say it in Spanish.

827
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,725
Regardless!

828
00:35:19,725 --> 00:35:23,460
we live our lives between glory and hell

829
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,520
And, well, with the glory period long gone with that lead...

830
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,200
We found ourselves stuck in what felt like Argentinian hell.

831
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,840
No more so than when the guy from the argument returned.

832
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,360
Because that thing he’s looking down at under his shirt.

833
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,800
Well you may not be able to see it.

834
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,760
But I can.

835
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,720
And it’s a gun.

836
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,720
And as desperate as I was document every angle of this final

837
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,160
from the perspective of the Buenos Aires streets.

838
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,320
Even I didn’t want to stick around to find out what happened next.

839
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,220
Eli: Let's go. He has a gun. Drive, drive. He has a gun

840
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,320
Why are you guys like this? So black and white?

841
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,910
Eli: Holy shit. Did you see that?

842
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,240
Heaven or Hell, it’s like...

843
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,560
Actually that’s the best analogy!

844
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,160
That’s Maradona! Heaven or Hell.

845
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,760
There’s no middle ground.

846
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,400
There’s no shades of grey.

847
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,400
Black or white.

848
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,440
Out of nowhere, 2-0 up and then...

849
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,280
We’re pulling guns on each other.

850
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,840
This beautiful...

851
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,520
Chaotic...

852
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,320
Glorious, but

853
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,840
flawed country man.

854
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,880
Their football. The experiences this tournament (creates)

855
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,800
Couldn’t embody this country more.

856
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,880
To go from such glorious highs...

857
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,960
to lows.

858
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,960
But if we thought we had seen the lowest point,

859
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,000
well, we were sorely mistaken

860
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,360
as only a few minutes later

861
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,080
and only a few blocks up the exact same street

862
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,000
we found out just how chaotic Argentina can get on such a day.

863
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:53,800
Something’s happening.

864
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,120
Just like those at the fan zone.

865
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,680
Just like those at Izzy’s house.

866
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:22,360
The emotional rollercoaster of this final had pushed me to the edge.

867
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,040
IGAL: Straight?

868
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,960
Ah, si, I don’t know anymore.

869
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,880
I don’t know where we’re going anymore.

870
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,400
I don’t know what’s going on anymore.

871
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,240
I don’t know what’s going on.

872
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,080
Just drive.

873
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,800
Drive.

874
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,520
F*ck Me

875
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,360
It’s 2-2 still?

876
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,360
Why did everyone think it was a penalty?

877
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,360
The guy in the bar was crying?

878
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,040
And so as full time was called

879
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,160
with the footpaths of Buenos Aires filled with despondent bodies

880
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,480
and the roads filled with SWAT teams preparing for the worst.

881
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,160
I tried my best to sum it all up.

882
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,480
Ah, how poetic.

883
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,000
The exact same spot where I stopped 30 minutes ago and said:

884
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,880
Let’s not get too excited at 2-0.

885
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,280
Since then it has gone to 2-2.

886
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,960
But in that time we’ve seen fights.

887
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,720
I’ve seen a gun. I’ve seen a man pull a gun.

888
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,120
And we’ve heard what we think are gunshots.

889
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,120
I said it up on the rooftop this morning...

890
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,360
I just can’t help thinking with...

891
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,120
what it’s 5:30 now?

892
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,360
Less than 7 hours to go...

893
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,000
Am I ready for this?

894
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,080
Are we ready for this?

895
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,920
Is this country ready for this?

896
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,600
When you consider how already emotional

897
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,640
they are about everything.

898
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,120
When you consider everything that’s gone in the last two weeks.

899
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,960
It’s like the entire city...

900
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,000
It’s spirit has been sucked through the drains.

901
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,160
People are crying on every corner.

902
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,400
People aren’t watching the match.

903
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,760
People are fighting.

904
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,440
And so the pain and the suffering and the...

905
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,120
the wait goes on.

906
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,600
And the emotions continue...

907
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,560
Extra time had came with a palpable shift in mood.

908
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,040
Where the anger at the giving up such a lead so quickly

909
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,960
had been replaced with a sadness

910
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,080
at just how precarious the situation was.

911
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,520
If Messi doesn't bring home this Cup

912
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,520
it's going to be Argentina's saddest Christmas

913
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,320
Of course. Remember World Cups are usually in June and July.

914
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,315
But now, with the change of date...

915
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,645
[losingl would make it the saddest Christmas in Argentinian history.

916
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,840
But it wasn’t for a lack of trying

917
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,520
as from the moment extra time kicked off

918
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,080
Argentina dominated.

919
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,800
With chance.

920
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,400
After chance.

921
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,360
After chance.

922
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,760
But ultimately nothing to show for it.

923
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,680
So as the first half of extra time came to an end,

924
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,440
despite the encouraging signs.

925
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,840
There was a feeling that with their best squad in decades

926
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,440
and arguably their best ever player,

927
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,200
Argentina had 15 minutes to finish the job

928
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,680
before it came down to the lottery of penalties.

929
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,360
For the final 15 minutes we were on the move again

930
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,120
and I only had once place in mind.

931
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,320
Tucuman street, where all the chaos had occurred.

932
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,160
Can we go past Tucuman (street) and just see?

933
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,200
Yeah, I just want to go down Tucuman.

934
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,840
Yeah, if there’s a cop car there now.

935
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,680
Let’s go past Tucuman.

936
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,040
And so as we headed back to Tucuman

937
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,800
once again all I could think about

938
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,920
was Izzy.

939
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,760
And how despite being so outspoken, he’d got so much right.

940
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,520
He’d doubted Argentina’s chances.

941
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,560
He’d predicted the ensuing nightmare.

942
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,160
And somehow, he’d even predicted how

943
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,840
the actual final would play out.

944
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,840
You’re two goals up in the final of a World Cup.

945
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,680
It’s there.

946
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,520
And they tie it! 2-2!

947
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,320
This is Tucuman. It’s right here. It’s right here.

948
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,280
Maradona...

949
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,240
He would grab the ball...tuk

950
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,160
and you can go and score.

951
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,760
Can we keep the camera down a bit lower.

952
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,880
You knew in your head he would save you.

953
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,880
And Messi is like...

954
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,000
I don’t know.

955
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,480
The guy pulled the gun right there.

956
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:35,880
IGAL: Yeah

957
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,320
You still believe that to this day?

958
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,200
Yes to this day.

959
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,120
And then in the 108th minute

960
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,760
As we sat outside Tucuman pondering what to do next...

961
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,720
He lacks epicness, Messi.

962
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:44,760
Izzy was finally proven wrong.
He lacks epicness, Messi.

963
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,240
Izzy was finally proven wrong.

964
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,280
You’re kidding me!

965
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,440
Argentina were back in the lead of a World Cup Final.

966
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,080
And if that wasn’t epic enough...

967
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,360
And if you thought Izzy’s remorse was a drastic change of heart

968
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,720
what was happening where we were, was on a whole other level.

969
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,440
That’s the man who pulled out the gun.

970
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,040
Only thirty minutes ago I saw that man pull out a gun.

971
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,800
And so once again the pendulum swung from Argentine hell

972
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,960
to a very Argentine glory.

973
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,160
I can’t stress this enough.

974
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,280
I can’t stress this enough.

975
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,840
You talk about the glorious highs and the epic lows.

976
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,400
Argentina...

977
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,760
That man pulled out a gun on someone in that exact spot...

978
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,760
All sense of control.

979
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,920
All sense of calm.

980
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,520
All sense of, well...

981
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,320
sense.

982
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,400
Had vanished in the whirlwind of chaos this match had created.

983
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,680
Where even the most stubborn were now questioning everything...

984
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,120
And so with the lead and the glory back in Argentina’s hands

985
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,800
with only minutes to go,

986
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,440
we got back in the taxi and headed towards the Obelisk

987
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,000
where in only a matter of moments

988
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,520
we knew the entire country would be descending...

989
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,480
But, we should have known better...

990
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,800
IGAL: Penalty for France.

991
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,480
You’re kidding me.

992
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,880
No, you’re kidding me.

993
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,520
Just like everyone else around the country

994
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,280
I had just given up trying to make sense

995
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,360
of what was going on.

996
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,960
How can I...

997
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,760
This country is...

998
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,640
Nah...

999
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,360
Nah...I’m done.

1000
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,840
When was the penalty?

1001
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,200
How can I??

1002
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,040
How can I articulate...

1003
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,360
What this is at this point?

1004
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,520
What’s going on...

1005
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,960
And so as we approached one of the main streets off the Obelisk

1006
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,280
we came across hundreds of others just like us

1007
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,720
who’d headed to the place of celebration a little too early

1008
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,720
and were now desperately trying to flock to nearby TV’s

1009
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,400
to try and get a view of the dying minutes of the game.

1010
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,440
And so, for the final time...

1011
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,160
we got out at another location.

1012
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,960
Where the mood was neither glorious nor hellish

1013
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,680
but instead a kind of Argentinian pergutory.

1014
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,680
And so as I stood amongst this scene of sadness

1015
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,320
trying to guess what was going on in the final moments of the game

1016
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,920
as I had no chance of getting near a TV screen.

1017
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,680
I came across Laura

1018
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,640
who, pacing up and down the street with tears in her eyes

1019
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,480
seemed particularly affected.

1020
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,880
But suffer they did, as those final minutes of extra time

1021
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,680
belonged to a resurgent France side

1022
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,920
aiming to score a fourth

1023
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,320
and put the final dagger into Argentina

1024
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,120
before we could even reach penalties.

1025
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,520
In all honesty...

1026
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,845
if Diego is on our side, l just don't know

1027
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,080
And so with Argentina holding on for dear life.

1028
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,980
It's the only joy we can look forward to in this country.

1029
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,280
It's the only joy.

1030
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,560
After 3 and half decades plus 120 minutes of excruciating waiting

1031
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,320
it looked like their World Cup dream, or nightmare

1032
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,400
would be decided in football’s most excruciating way.

1033
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,360
Penalties?

1034
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,840
We’re going to penalties.

1035
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,720
Diego if you’re up there...

1036
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,880
Please, there’s five kicks.

1037
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,200
And so this was it.

1038
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,880
After 36 and a half years.

1039
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,600
Or 462 months.

1040
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,240
Or 13, 321 days.

1041
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,480
Somehow this country’s ultimate desire.

1042
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,800
Ultimate obsession.

1043
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,960
Ultimate dream.

1044
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,320
Was now at the mercy of a series of kicks from the 12 yard spot.

1045
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,595
If we go to penalties, but if we go to penalties?

1046
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,330
That would be too much tension

1047
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Some people don't even watch. They go

1048
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,990
Nobody would want to watch such a game

1049
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,040
Does Messi take the first kick? Or the fifth kick?

1050
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,165
No, Messi needs to take the first kick

1051
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,880
- The best always shoots first!-Shoots first, yes

1052
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,240
One round in and the shootout was already taking it’s toll

1053
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,840
No more so, than on Laura...

1054
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:56,000
Argentina, up until now, has always given us a bitter sweet taste

1055
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,400
Because we've made so many finals, but had so little success

1056
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:09,240
Because if you play bad and you lose, that's okay.

1057
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,720
But if you play well and don't win...

1058
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,095
whilst having the best player in the world who takes you to finals

1059
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,120
more than anything, it's a sadness

1060
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,120
Because, football deserves it.

1061
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:27,755
So the fact that he made it to the final in his last World Cup

1062
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,335
it's the right call by destiny.

1063
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:36,145
That life gives you bad things, but if you hang on, in good faith,

1064
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,460
it will come good.

1065
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,480
So l think that's what awictory against France would be.

1066
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,580
It's a true punch that can give us good things

1067
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,600
after so much disappointment.

1068
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,640
It's true what my nephew says...

1069
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,940
I think that destiny cannot be wrong

1070
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,310
And destiny is set up in a way

1071
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,480
that no matter what, the winner of this match will be..Argentina

1072
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,520
The second round of penalties had brought a whole new mood.

1073
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,000
But it was the next round...

1074
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,040
that really saw things change.

1075
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:42,040
Saved!

1076
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,000
Penalty saved!

1077
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,800
And so with a 3-1 lead going into the fourth round of kicks

1078
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,400
Argentina just needed to save France’s next penalty

1079
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,320
to win the game, and the tournament.

1080
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:21,040
And the realisation was hitting harder than ever...

1081
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,960
And whilst France converted their fourth to stay alive

1082
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,440
Argentina would still win the World Cup by scoring their next.

1083
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,150
l'm a Boca fan...

1084
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,685
but Argentina winning the World Cup is the ultimate.

1085
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,485
I would trade anything for it.

1086
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:03,800
What l want most of all is for Argentina to win this World Cup

1087
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,025
for them (the young). For those who haven't seen it.

1088
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,990
You cannot describe what it's like when

1089
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:11,765
Argentina win the World Cup

1090
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,070
I get emotional talking about Argentina.

1091
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:32,520
I carry it in my soul, and l see what they're doing to us.

1092
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,895
It's all part of the same thing

1093
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:41,720
I can see that the kids that are studying, working, trying hard...

1094
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,920
have no future here and they leave

1095
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,775
And that kills me.

1096
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,320
I'm bringing several topics to the table, but...

1097
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,545
it's the only joy we can aspire to and

1098
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:57,460
that's why l'm praying to God that we can win the World Cup

1099
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,200
Football.

1100
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,840
Not sport, football.

1101
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,600
Football, is the greatest thing on earth.

1102
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,440
I’m not having it any other way.

1103
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,800
It’s the most beautiful thing, it’s the most ugly thing.

1104
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,080
It’s the most romantic thing and it’s the most heartbreaking thing.

1105
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,640
It is the most, emotional thing...

1106
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,320
It is the most, Argentinian thing.

1107
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:22,720
And with one more penalty, with one more penalty...

1108
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,440
they end the most romantic story...

1109
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,600
Argentina.

1110
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,960
Lionel Messi.

1111
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,040
Are World Champions.

1112
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,680
The most beautiful story.

1113
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,120
In the most beautiful game.

1114
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,040
In the most beautiful tournament of all.

1115
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,200
I think the yearning for success for Argentina

1116
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,560
I think it’s very hard to overestimate

1117
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,080
just how much they needed to win

1118
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,360
particularly the World Cup.

1119
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,440
It’s been really difficult in Argentina.

1120
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,320
It’s been difficult socially.

1121
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,440
It’s been difficult economically.

1122
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,600
It’s been difficult politically.

1123
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:48,520
And so this one moment of pride they’ve been desperate for...

1124
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:49,600
to finally get that.

1125
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,960
And to do it in what’s almost certainly Messi’s last tournament.

1126
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,960
In his fifth World Cup.

1127
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,960
That’s why it means so much...

1128
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,200
For Messi and Argentina it was the perfect finale.

1129
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,200
It was love.

1130
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,320
It was the romance coming together after all these...

1131
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:12,480
highs and lows.

1132
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,080
I’m sorry Messi.

1133
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,440
I ask for your forgiveness.

1134
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,400
I killed you for years.

1135
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,240
I’m sorry, I’m sorry!

1136
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:46,160
What we suffered and what we enjoyed in that World Cup.

1137
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,240
No other memory can take that away.

1138
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,600
It’s gonna be special, forever.

1139
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,240
And the fact that it’s December.

1140
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,120
The fact that it’s not the normal time for the World Cup Final.

1141
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,640
Argentinians experienced it differently.

1142
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,160
The fact that it was their summer rather than their winter.

1143
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:07,160
There’s this question that’s been there since the British retreat

1144
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:10,400
from Argentina in the first couple of decades of the 20th century.

1145
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,160
Que es Argentinidad? What is it?

1146
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,280
What is Argentinian-ness?

1147
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,640
What is it to be Argentinian?

1148
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,680
And what it is now is football.

1149
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,640
That is the way that Argentina expresses itself on the world stage.

1150
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,520
And seeing the scenes after the final of...

1151
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,200
5 million people or whatever it was out on the streets celebrating.

1152
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,840
4 million people on the streets...

1153
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:31,320
Could of been 10, could of been 20, you never know, but,

1154
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,880
Messi winning the World Cup,

1155
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,120
scoring two goals in the final,

1156
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,040
in Summer.

1157
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:40,360
All the planets aligned into a perfect moment.

1158
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,360
And I think it’s the best story

1159
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:46,850
that you could write about a football game ever.
