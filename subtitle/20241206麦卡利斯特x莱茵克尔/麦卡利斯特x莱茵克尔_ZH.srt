But yeah, we have the freedom to do whatever we want.

539
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:51,704

所以。
So.

678
00:37:57,752 --> 00:38:01,849
例如，在我们进入球场之前，他总是说话并说
for example before we go into the pitch he always speaks and says

But as I said, his leadership is amazing.
But as I said, his leadership is amazing.

683

It's not just by word, but it's more by example.

684
00:38:20,606 --> 00:38:21,888

691

710
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:38,435

753
00:41:53,257 --> 00:41:54,279
法国打不过。

754
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,482
他们只是不在其中。
They're just not in it.

755
00:41:56,323 --> 00:41:59,355

And then suddenly, from two and a lot, you're two-two.

756
00:41:59,656 --> 00:41:59,897

758
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:04,961

That must have been like, what on earth is happening here?

759
00:42:05,263 --> 00:42:07,395

For sure, it wasn't easy.

760
00:42:11,502 --> 00:42:12,246
当他们打进2-1的比分时
when they score the 2-1,
when they score the 2-1,

761
00:42:15,641 --> 00:42:16,042
我不知道。
I don't know.

762
00:42:16,062 --> 00:42:18,265
我对自己还是很有信心的。
I was still confident in ourself.

763
00:42:20,028 --> 00:42:21,310
但在这之后，

764
00:42:21,631 --> 00:42:23,082
均衡器
the equalizer

765
00:42:24,181 --> 00:42:25,082
太难了。
It was so hard.

766
00:42:25,262 --> 00:42:25,783
太难了。
It was so hard.

767
00:42:25,803 --> 00:42:29,027
我想当时大家都很紧张。
I think everyone got nervous at that time.

768
00:42:29,227 --> 00:42:29,888
这并不容易。
It wasn't easy.

769
00:42:29,948 --> 00:42:30,268
但后来...
But then...
But then...

770
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:36,285
再次，就像对阵荷兰一样，我们进入加时赛，我们再次展现了自己的表现。
Again, like against Holland, we went to extra time, we showed again.

然后又发生了。
And then it happened again.
And then it happened again.

773
00:42:41,673 --> 00:42:44,841
所以我认为，正如你所说，对于中立者来说，这是一场疯狂的游戏。
So it was a crazy game, I think, for neutrals, as you say.
So it was a crazy game, I think, for neutrals, as you say.

774
00:42:45,122 --> 00:42:48,330

It was the most extraordinary match, I think the most memorable in my lifetime.

775
00:42:48,811 --> 00:42:53,763

I probably played in the second most memorable match of all time, which was Mexico 86, the quarter final.
I probably played in the second most memorable match of all time, which was Mexico 86, the quarter final.

776
00:42:54,405 --> 00:43:00,003
因为迭戈的两个进球，其中一个是用手进球，显然，其中一个进球可能是有史以来最好的进球。
because of Diego's two goals, one with the hand and obviously one was the best goal probably ever scored.
because of Diego's two goals, one with the hand and obviously one was the best goal probably ever scored.

777
00:43:00,845 --> 00:43:06,094
但为了生活，成为团队的一员，经历情绪的过山车，
But to live that, to be part of the team, to go through that emotional roller coaster,
But to live that, to be part of the team, to go through that emotional roller coaster,

778
00:43:06,495 --> 00:43:09,042
然后是点球大战。
And then the penalty shootout.
And then the penalty shootout.

779
00:43:09,644 --> 00:43:11,911
我一直以为你会因为你的守门员而赢得点球大战。
I always thought you'd win a penalty shootout because of your goalkeeper.
I always thought you'd win a penalty shootout because of your goalkeeper.

780
00:43:12,332 --> 00:43:13,858

838
00:46:36,124 --> 00:46:40,148

863
00:48:00,017 --> 00:48:04,883

865
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:07,812
所以...
So...

866
00:48:09,097 --> 00:48:13,152
如果有两三个人在场，那么球场上就有一部分是空闲的。

And it's almost like he's playing the game.

881
00:49:05,808 --> 00:49:10,037

887

889
00:49:24,944 --> 00:49:30,116

894
00:49:46,065 --> 00:49:48,249
对他来说一切看起来都很容易
everything looks easy for him
