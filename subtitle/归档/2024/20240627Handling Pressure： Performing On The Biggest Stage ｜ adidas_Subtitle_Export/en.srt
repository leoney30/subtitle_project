1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,800
Pressure can lead you to the bad or the good.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,700
I feel everything: the emotions,

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,600
the desire to play football.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,200
I love the atmosphere,

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,400
the pressure, the fans.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,800
I understand half of it, but I understand.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,300
My family motivates me.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,300
I am in love with football.

9
00:00:23,933 --> 00:00:25,300
DEFINITION OF PRESSURE

10
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,600
It's something we feel everyday.

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,900
It ends up being natural.

12
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,900
It's hard to handle it.

13
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,100
Pressure: Moral force or influence exerted on a person to condition his or her behavior.

14
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,200
"Resist social pressures" Similar: coercion, duress, compulsion, constraint, imposition, influence, coercion, commandment

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,500
I think it's important not to hide the pressure,

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,900
but rather to normalize it.

17
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,400
The pressure on the field

18
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,800
in the end, it ends up being something natural.

19
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,100
I, personally, have a way of

20
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,200
eliminate the pressure unconsciously.

21
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,600
In the end, it is something we have everyday.

22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,400
Being players of big clubs,

23
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,600
of a team like the Argentine national team.

24
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,600
When I enter the field,

25
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,800
everything that happens off the field

26
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,100
does not interfere with what I am doing.

27
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,300
Pressure can lead you to the bad or the good.

28
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,400
The pressure on someone, pressuring someone,

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,800
can bring out the best, as it happens to me.

30
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,000
It motivates me.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,800
I feel it brings out the best in me.

32
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,800
Pressure is hard to handle.

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We always try to stay calm,

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
try not to think too much, about what, about what, we are playing,

35
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,700
although it is also difficult.

36
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,300
So, pressure... I can say

37
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,200
that I know how to deal with it very well.

38
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,400
The World Cup was a clear example of that, of how pressure pushed me further.

39
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,900
We had the personality to face it,

40
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,300
and all that pressure, and that nervousness

41
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,400
made us stronger as a group and individually.

42
00:01:46,633 --> 00:01:49,900
Family

43
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,900
I remember the game against Brazil.

44
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,800
It was very special because I had many things on my mind.

45
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,600
Because, I was going through a situation.

46
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,700
Not a very good one, because of my family, because of what happened with my father.

47
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,900
There were many thoughts, many motivations,

48
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,400
a lot of desire to go to the field and win.

49
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
And it was like that.

50
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,000
I scored two goals,

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,200
that I gave to the team and it was a spectacular day.

52
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,500
Leaving my family at 12 years old,

53
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,400
and going to Indepediente’s boarding school

54
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,700
and then, leaving my brother alone in Argentina

55
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,400
going to England at 16, 17 years old.

56
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,000
That, actually, is pressure. Being away from your family,

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,500
not knowing if you will make it and having my family far away, that is bad.

58
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,000
The pressure of playing on a field

59
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,100
or playing, I don't know, with my friends.

60
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,400
I feel like I am doing what I like. What I know to do.

61
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,600
And I try to do it the best I can.

62
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,200
I love the environment,

63
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,800
the pressure, the fans, the atmosphere.

64
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,500
I am passionate about football.

65
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,800
And I believe that in any job, if you do it with love and really like it,

66
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,200
you enjoy it, no matter how exhausting it is.

67
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,400
It was a childhood dream,

68
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,400
and that has always motivated me.

69
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,000
And it is what continues to motivate me today.

70
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,700
It's thinking that… it is a,that it is a game,

71
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,800
that it is fun, that you win,

72
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,900
you lose, you draw,

73
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,300
any of those three things can happen. And we have to assimilate whatever it comes.

74
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,600
That way, I try to stay calm.

75
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:27,500
The game that made me the most nervous was my first professional game.

76
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
When I was younger, I didn't know what to expect.

77
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,500
Or even my first game with Chile.

78
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,200
A big occasion, many expectations. Also for friends and family.

79
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,400
And it is impossible to forget.

80
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,000
It was the 2014 World Cup final

81
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,300
in which I couldn't play and well… The pressure of whether I could play

82
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,600
or not, if I was injured.If they were going to give me an injection, all of that

83
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,400
it overwhelmed me too much.

84
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,700
I cried at night, I cried in the morning.

85
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,600
The game we had

86
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,200
four or five days after Saudi Arabia, against Mexico.

87
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,100
And I think it was waking up in the morning and saying "if I lose, I go home".

88
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,700
I believe in fact that was

89
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,500
the match with the most anxiety and with the most nervousness in my entire career.

90
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,600
I think the game I was most nervous about

91
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,200
was my World Cup debut.

92
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,500
When the coach called me. That was the most anxious moment of my life.

93
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,000
My first game when I debuted with the main National Team was ethe one I was most nervous about.

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,600
Because it was the first time and I played as a starter

95
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:38,000
so it was a bit difficult to assimilate everything.

96
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,800
You get a little nervous, even

97
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,800
when the referee blows the whistle. But only until the initial whistle.

98
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,600
Then, everything becomes normal.

99
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,200
When you are playing with your friends,

100
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,100
you are not going to lose any championship,

101
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:57,300
you are not going to make it reflect on a whole city or country.

102
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,600
You are there playing with your friends to have fun.

103
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,400
And on a football field, you have the responsibility to make millions of people happy.

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,900
I think in the big games,

105
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,300
when you get those butterflies in your tummy,

106
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,600
I think it's an amazing feeling.

107
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,400
When you play as a child, you play for fun, and

108
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,000
I remember, we played to see who would pay for the barbecue.

109
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,900
What motivates me the most to strive more and more are probably different scenarios:

110
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,500
When I put on the Chile shirt, for my country, for my family, for my friends.

111
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,600
And also when you play at club level it is also for my teammates, and the fans.

112
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,600
In my mind, before starting the game,

113
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,700
I feel everything: the emotions,

114
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,900
the desire to play football

115
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,300
and of course, it is my passion.

116
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,200
In a warm-up. I remember, in the World Cup,

117
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,500
I can't recall what game it was,

118
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,300
if quarters or semifinals.

119
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,100
I was warming up,

120
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,200
And usually when you play here in England

121
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,800
when you play somewhere else, it's cold…

122
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,700
you have to motivate yourself,

123
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,900
you have to motivate yourself to defend well.

124
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,800
And there, it seemed that the fans were motivating me.

125
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,700
it was like sweating, and being with the crowd

126
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,900
and I felt that I was enjoying the warm-up.

127
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,300
I remember when I was a child and played

128
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,300
I try to do that in the game too.

129
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,600
What motivates me are my daughters.

130
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,200
To be able to show them that we can. That, with consistency,

131
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,700
that, with effort everything can be achieved. Everything can be overcomed

132
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,400
I followed my father since I was a child, who also played football

133
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,800
and with following his footsteps, I found a passion

134
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,700
I am in love with football.

135
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,200
Passion

136
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,300
You imagine

137
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,900
The things that could happen on the field

138
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,700
and that obviously are constant with what is happening.

139
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,400
I think I handled it well, I handled that pressure well,

140
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,500
I handled that moment well.

141
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,400
I tried minute by minute to handle it in the best way.

142
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,100
Focus on if something went wrong, I could overcome it.

143
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,300
And it was like that.

144
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,500
I scored a goal, I remember that match... and I managed to overcome it.

145
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,700
My best experience was at the World Cup

146
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,500
and when I went to play against France

147
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,600
those seconds, it was looking at my tammates and everyone was looking back

148
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,100
as if they needed me and I

149
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,700
stayed calm, do my routine.

150
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,800
Focus as much as possible on my work, forgetting the outside, focusing on my teammates.

151
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,600
Forget the outside and think only about what we have to do on the field.

152
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,900
I learned to deal with pressure during the week,

153
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,400
in every habit, in every meal,

154
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,300
in every night that I go to bed early.

155
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,600
And I believe in the routine,

156
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,900
I think that's how you can handle it well.

157
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,200
Playing in a World Cup

158
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,400
with billions of people watching, is a totally different pressure,

159
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,800
but the good thing is that we have a group,

160
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,400
that was like playing with Friends and when you play with friends

161
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,300
it's always… it is fun.

162
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:12,900
Look, I think it is one of the games we were losing recently.

163
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,700
3-1 at home.

164
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:19,300
And from the moment we scored a goal, our fans came with everything.

165
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,200
They pushed us to turn the situation around, and we managed to turn it around,

166
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,100
in the last five minutes. We scored three goals in six minutes.

167
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,700
All games can be won like in life.

168
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,600
If someone wants something and works hard

169
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,200
and makes many sacrifices to get there

170
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,500
everything can be achieved.

171
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,200
And those ten seconds I take for myself.

172
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,800
Today I come out victorious. Today I win, today I win, today I win.

173
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
and I see nothing else but winning.

174
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,100
And I repeat to myself, I repeat, I repeat until I believe it.

175
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,700
Even knowing that it is our job and what feeds us.

176
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,600
I think that becomes secondary,

177
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,200
when you realize all the moments that you can

178
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,600
vivir junto a este deporte.

179
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,600
For me, in football or in life, I never give up.

180
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,000
An occasion when pressure pushed me further,

181
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,300
I think it was in the penalty shootout against…

182
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,300
against Honduras.

183
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,000
I had missed two penalties and

184
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,400
ended up being the first to kick

185
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,200
with the Mexican National Team.

186
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,000
And I knew I had that responsibility to score to advance to the semifinals;

187
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,900
and also with the pressure of knowing that a whole country depends on you.

188
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,300
I think the most important thing is to focus on

189
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,400
practicing the sport and playing what we like the most.

190
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,400
And since I started playing

191
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,000
I always faced it that way, in having fun, in enjoying.

192
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,800
Of course, at times there is more pressure than others

193
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,900
and the reality is different,

194
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,400
but in the end

195
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,000
it is a game you want to enjoy and have fun with.

196
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,600
I learned a lot to deal with pressure

197
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,900
in conversations, in several conversations with my family,

198
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,600
who are football, people who played,

199
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,800
who were on the field and knew what it meant,

200
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,300
so they were always there to teach me

201
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,200
how to overcome all This and how to

202
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,400
make it just a driving force.

203
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,000
What motivates me to strive more

204
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,100
and more is to fulfill my dreams,

205
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,800
also because I know that my family

206
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,300
is proud of me.

207
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,400
My children and my family.

208
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,800
All my life I fought for my family

209
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,300
when it was in Mar del Plata and today I do it for my children.

210
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,500
For my family. To deal with the pressure.

211
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,800
Living a normal life, makes you get out a little of what this pressure is

212
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,400
that you can feel and for me it is fundamental.

213
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,600
I use it as… I don't know how to explain it to you…

214
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,000
when you have a good car and put the best gasoline in it.

215
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,600
I feel that the people of Argentina gives me that gasoline

216
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,000
I need to start the game.

217
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,900
Football

218
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,600
I play football because it is what I am passionate about,

219
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,700
It is what I have always liked, since I was little

220
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,100
I play football because it is what I have always done when I was younger

221
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,200
I love playing football.

222
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,100
I play football because I like it, because I enjoy it a lot,

223
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,300
because I come from a family that taught me what it means.

224
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,500
Because since I was a child I followed my father.

225
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,300
I have always dreamed of being a professional player.

226
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,500
I always dreamed of playing in a big club.

227
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:38,033
I play football because it has always been my dream

228
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:41,000
It's my passion, my life.

229
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,800
It's the only thing I know to do, and that's why I play football.

230
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,500
Out of love.

231
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,400
I love football.

232
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,200
I love my profesión I love diving, I love getting hurt…

233
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:53,033
Because I love football, because it makes me happy to play football

234
00:11:53,033 --> 00:11:56,966
I feel it makes me happy. Makes my family happy.

235
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,900
And I try to make the children happy too, the number of children

236
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:07,366
who follow us and try to show that everything is possible.
