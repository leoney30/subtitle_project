00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,700
Obviamente siempre me ha agradecido, recién mismo el lautaro, meter el gol en la final.

7
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:39,850
Mis compañeros de la selección, Alaston Villa, hoy tengo el placer de estar con los dos  entrenadores arquero mío que me ven todos los días,

00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:44,080

9
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,860
Vengo siempre de un lugar chico y siempre lo recuerdo y eso es lo que me motiva siempre a.

10
00:01:50,690 --> 00:02:00,560
A seguir queriendo crecer, a seguir obsesionado con mejorar, conseguir cosas grupales que para mí es lo individual. Siempre viene después de lo grupal,

11
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,130
 así que nada, agradecidos a todos, siempre y gracias. Bueno, a todo lo que metió gol en la final.

12
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,720
Congratulations, Emiliano.

13
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,640
What an amazing year you've had.

14
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,365
Let's watch together how you became the Impassable.

15
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,570
The best goalkeeper award at a major tournament for Emiliano Martinez.

16
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,070
Emiliano  You win this trophy back to back.

17
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,670
This is first time in history.  This is huge for you.

18
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:49,770
Yeah, to be first.

19
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,010
He's huge for me.

20
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,370
You know, I always dream I play one game for the national team.

21
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,025
You know, and you know, coming from such a young lad to England,

22
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:07,525
 you know, trying to walk my way through, succeed Austin Villa and the national team, you know,

23
00:04:07,525 --> 00:04:13,960
winning ones for me was an honor, you know, back to back is something that I never expected to be fair.

24
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,710
I'm just proud to be here today and all thanks to my family and my friends.

25
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,220
you're a very special person.

26
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,340
I think we all know that now.

27
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,060
You're kind of a showman.

28
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,020
You know, you like to provoke your opponents.

29
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,830
You like to unsettle them.

30
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,590
We never know what your next move will be.

31
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,250
Is that you like your special touch?

32
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,290
No, it's not my special touch.

33
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,924
You know, sometimes when you're on the pitch, you behave the way you want to win the game.

34
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,170
You know, off the pitch, I'm a dad.

35
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:57,080
You know I'm a pro man, you know, I'm a husband, I'm a brother.  I'm a son.

36
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,120
On the pitch, I just want to do everything I can to help my national team and my club, which is Aston Villa.

37
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,560
You know, we're doing something amazing in the club.

38
00:05:04,881 --> 00:05:10,861
We're moving forward, you know. We won back-to-back trophies with the national team, and that's all I care, to be fair.

39
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,820
Good.

40
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,020
But sometimes it can be seen as too much, right?

41
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,910
Well, that's the way you see it, you know, for Argentinian people now.

42
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,185
Perfect. Perfect answer.

43
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,230
You even have to apologize, even how to apologize.

44
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:31,970
But you are the best keeper, goalkeeper in the world right now.

45
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:38,960
You know, being elected back to back champion, winning the Copa America,

46
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,360
I mean, you're the best.

47
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,450
Now, to be fair, I don't see myself as the best.

48
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:49,850
You know, there's so many good goalies I see today that I see week in, week out.

49
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:57,820
Like I said, I only care about group titles, you know, with the national team, we Aston Villa, that's sort of focus on myself mostly.

50
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,500
My Gobley coach is now more than me.

51
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,810
The work I put every day.

52
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,010
We have Ian Martin.

53
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,850
So for me to improve myself, that's like a.

54
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:13,510
Lautaro,We want to know how is Emiliano out of the pitch or in the locker room? You see him every day.

55
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,010
Bueno, Emiliano.

56
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:26,375
Para nosotros es una persona especial porque es ganador primera cosa

57
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:30,050
 y eso es importante dentro de un de un equipo.

58
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,525
Después.  Ayuda a los más jóvenes,

59
00:06:34,525 --> 00:06:40,820
ayuda a los chicos que vienen a entrenar con nosotros en la selección

60
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,320
  después puedo hablar solo palabras bonitas hacia él porque.

61
00:06:46,265 --> 00:06:48,040
 es una gran persona.

62
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:54,101
Como dije antes, quizá todo lo que hace, lo hace porque él quiere ganar  y no va más allá de eso.

63
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,920
Great example for young goalkeepers.

64
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,360
Lautaro, if you had to take 10 penalty shots against Emiliano,

65
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,515
the specialist of course, how many do you think you would score?

66
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,280
No mientas.

67
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,490
No sé, muy difícil.

68
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,120
Five, ten?

69
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,615
Un poco más.

70
00:07:22,661 --> 00:07:29,650
Pero es muy difícil, es muy difícil porque primero es grande y segundo espera hasta lo último. Mira mucho.

71
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,280
¿Y vos, Didier, vos amitaría conmigo?

72
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,485
 how many would you actually score Didier?

73
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,010
Maybe 9,10.

74
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,090
He's still in good shape.

75
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,520
Thank you very much.

76
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,360
Thank you very much.

77
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,900
Ladies and gentlemen, shall be Emiliano Martinez.
