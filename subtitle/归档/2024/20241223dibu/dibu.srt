1
00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:04,214
To opponents' team supporters, you have become your own kind of villain.

2
00:00:04,695 --> 00:00:07,602
I just look at myself, I never look at the others.

3
00:00:07,622 --> 00:00:10,990
I don't care what the fans say or the opponents or the managers.

4
00:00:12,332 --> 00:00:16,356
I just help my back four and I try to make as many saves as I can.

5
00:00:16,536 --> 00:00:22,293
My guest today is an elite goalkeeper who's the Magnus Carlsen of mind games.

6
00:00:22,755 --> 00:00:28,292
six foot five inches of hip shaking crowd shushing penalty repelling menace

7
00:00:28,954 --> 00:00:33,964
Just this week, he was named FIFA's best men's goalkeeper for the second time in three years.

8
00:00:34,445 --> 00:00:39,287
And exactly two years ago to this day, he rather enthusiastically

9
00:00:39,589 --> 00:00:44,031
accepted the gold glove trophy after winning the World Cup with Argentina.

10
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:48,498
It's an incredible joy to welcome Aston Villa's Mr. Emi Martinez.

11
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:49,640
Hello, Rog.

12
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,141
You all right, mate?

13
00:00:50,621 --> 00:00:55,171
Oh, I am now, Emmy, because we are speaking just a few days after you made...

14
00:00:55,912 --> 00:01:01,057
What for some goalkeepers would be a career-defining save against Nottingham Forest?

15
00:01:01,438 --> 00:01:05,951
Somehow denied a header from Nicolas Dominguez at point-blank range.

16
00:01:06,252 --> 00:01:09,302
It's like a behind the back save with added spin.

17
00:01:09,322 --> 00:01:11,067
It's pot goalkeeping feet.

18
00:01:11,548 --> 00:01:13,575
Like, part Mission Impossible stunt.

19
00:01:13,796 --> 00:01:14,639
What did you see...

20
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,970
How did you experience it and how did it feel in that moment?

21
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:23,152
Well, to be fair, I was trying to get some space

22
00:01:23,453 --> 00:01:29,088
to catch the cross, you know, I'm always, you know, I go keep a front footer to try and do the high claims.

23
00:01:29,249 --> 00:01:29,630
And then I was

24
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,781
a lot of bodies in front of me, you know, and the ball was really good into the near post, they couldn't come.

25
00:01:34,403 --> 00:01:40,294
And I think they, Gipsway, he flicked it and then Dominguez just had it from

26
00:01:40,595 --> 00:01:46,860
I don't know, two yards, you know, and I was a good header actually towards the goal and then I saw the ball behind me.

27
00:01:47,781 --> 00:01:53,795
And somehow we just try to drag it back into play to generate a little bit of power and then

28
00:01:54,677 --> 00:01:55,898
I didn't touch it.

29
00:01:55,918 --> 00:02:00,742
You know, normally it goes through your hands or you score an own goal if you try to bring it back.

30
00:02:00,942 --> 00:02:05,237
So I have to spin the other side of the ball to make sure I don't touch it.

31
00:02:07,224 --> 00:02:10,977
But we lost the game at the end, so a little bit frustrated.

32
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:11,639
The spin.

33
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,483
to reverse it for the goal line.

34
00:02:13,723 --> 00:02:16,288
All that thinking in like that second.

35
00:02:16,548 --> 00:02:18,273
Is the spin just instinct, Em?

36
00:02:18,353 --> 00:02:19,998
I choose my hand followed, you know,

37
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:23,948
When I spun my back, my hand, my body followed.

38
00:02:24,068 --> 00:02:26,555
So it's not something I thought at the moment, it's just, you know,

39
00:02:27,618 --> 00:02:29,467
With that kind of save, you have to sweep.

40
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,174
And that's something you train.

41
00:02:31,636 --> 00:02:36,396
Jamie Redknapp on English TV said he thought it was the greatest save of the Premier League.

42
00:02:36,676 --> 00:02:42,781
era not the season of the era for you does it even crack your top five where do you rank this technically

43
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:49,193
For me, I don't really rank myself amongst the others, but for me it was,

44
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:53,148
It was my best one, my best technical skill goalkeeping save.

45
00:02:53,188 --> 00:02:54,112
So, you know, and

46
00:02:54,614 --> 00:02:58,936
and that's something I should be proud of because even at this age I keep improving.

47
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,524
which is amazing, the goalkeeper's journey.

48
00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:05,777
And I know you've worked with a psychologist, David Priestley, to build that mindset.

49
00:03:06,178 --> 00:03:11,623
at Arsenal you've called your meetings with him quote an investment into your weekend performances

50
00:03:12,144 --> 00:03:18,583
Can you describe to us the mental process you go through in game to maintain positivity in key moments?

51
00:03:19,104 --> 00:03:24,201
Yeah, he's one of the major keys for my success as well, you know, to keep me there.

52
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:29,244
you know, never too low and never too high, you know, keep me balanced, you know, keep me consistent.

53
00:03:29,505 --> 00:03:35,800
and that's why for professional athletes it's a harder thing to do to maintain that consistency

54
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:41,731
for 60 games in a season over six, seven years or 10 years of career, you know.

55
00:03:42,413 --> 00:03:46,011
And that's something that made me for my last six years of my career or seven has been

56
00:03:46,573 --> 00:03:51,429
super consistent, improving every season and that's how I want to finish.

57
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:56,418
You famously have a tattoo on your calf of the World Cup trophy.

58
00:03:56,638 --> 00:03:57,780
You won it two years ago.

59
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,365
And you had it inked in the exact spot on your leg where you saved that shot.

60
00:04:02,765 --> 00:04:06,582
From Francis Randall Kona Moana, you get extra time at the final.

61
00:04:06,904 --> 00:04:08,732
Argentina's first World Cup win since 1986.

62
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,424
What emotions do you experience on the daily when you look down on your leg?

63
00:04:14,884 --> 00:04:19,295
you see that trophy looking back at you and you think about your own key part in winning it.

64
00:04:19,355 --> 00:04:20,939
Yeah, it's amazing because we...

65
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:26,453
We made a bet with some of my mates in the national teams after we lost the first game.

66
00:04:27,014 --> 00:04:31,978
I say, if we win the World Cup, we're going to do a tattoo with our names as well, with our shirt numbers.

67
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:38,386
So when I saved that ball and we won the World Cup, they all said, we all know where you're going to do the tattoo.

68
00:04:39,268 --> 00:04:41,795
You have to do it there, you have to do it in that spot.

69
00:04:42,717 --> 00:04:46,609
I just put the star in the exact spot where the ball hit.

70
00:04:48,934 --> 00:04:54,487
So when it's in my tattoo, the 22 star is exactly where the ball hit.

71
00:04:55,693 --> 00:04:57,724
And when you look at it, what do you feel?

72
00:04:58,328 --> 00:04:58,850
Just proud.

73
00:04:59,272 --> 00:05:05,546
You know, I came to England with such a young age, you know, without speaking the language.

74
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:09,777
different weather, different people and different culture.

75
00:05:10,097 --> 00:05:11,701
Looking back 16 years ago,

76
00:05:12,463 --> 00:05:18,799
I'm still proud to be here, being an award champion, winning so many titles and individual awards.

77
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,302
It just makes me proud.

78
00:05:20,443 --> 00:05:22,869
It makes me keep going.

79
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,357
I always look back to help me to keep improving.

80
00:05:26,558 --> 00:05:27,341
Little messy.

81
00:05:27,883 --> 00:05:30,834
Rosario born, now Miami-based, human wonder.

82
00:05:31,195 --> 00:05:33,939
He's called you the best goalkeeper in the world.

83
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:37,203
And you played with him on the Argentinian national team since 2017.

84
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:41,029
And I don't mean this as a weird question.

85
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:46,361
But as new players, when you join the national team, are you nervous when you meet him?

86
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:48,325
Because to the world, Messi is a god.

87
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:55,272
But after a while, does he just become like a normal teammate or does he remain in the locker room, on the field?

88
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:58,175
a gent who plays with goat aura?

89
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,296
No, to be fair,

90
00:06:00,118 --> 00:06:02,489
With all the players, maybe yes, but for me, you know,

91
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:06,100
We all the same, you know, I'm very, you know, a fighting lad.

92
00:06:06,161 --> 00:06:07,805
I make jokes to everyone.

93
00:06:08,447 --> 00:06:10,275
he's got an aura that no one has.

94
00:06:10,777 --> 00:06:12,485
You know, he's someone like,

95
00:06:12,725 --> 00:06:15,990
you look up to, when you see him, whatever he does, you try to copy.

96
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,534
He goes to the gym, you go to the gym, he's got that aura.

97
00:06:19,395 --> 00:06:21,300
that I think no one in football have.

98
00:06:22,022 --> 00:06:22,483
But then

99
00:06:22,944 --> 00:06:24,650
For me, everyone is the same.

100
00:06:25,032 --> 00:06:28,223
We all joke, you know, we have meals together.

101
00:06:29,286 --> 00:06:34,332
He's a lovely human being, but he has a super talent.

102
00:06:35,934 --> 00:06:39,944
When you're born with a super talent that no one has, he's that man.

103
00:06:40,265 --> 00:06:41,408
It's like John McGinn or...

104
00:06:42,214 --> 00:06:43,206
Yeah, like guinea, yeah.

105
00:06:45,628 --> 00:06:50,863
In that World Cup final, you've talked about how you briefed your Argentinian teammates how to take their penalties.

106
00:06:51,264 --> 00:06:53,731
to beat your French opponent, Hugo Lloris.

107
00:06:53,932 --> 00:06:56,198
You are incredibly difficult to score against.

108
00:06:56,218 --> 00:06:57,501
You're famously difficult.

109
00:06:57,963 --> 00:07:02,340
And you've said, quote, in those moments, I own my box.

110
00:07:03,143 --> 00:07:08,398
Can you break down what makes you so bloody dominant in penalties, any kind of penalty?

111
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:09,822
But is it preparation?

112
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:14,931
intelligence is it learning your opponent's tendencies or is it just instinct

113
00:07:15,091 --> 00:07:19,743
I think a penalty during the game is just a penalty.

114
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:26,781
a penalty shootout is a different sport and I'm pretty good at it you know that's how I see it you know

115
00:07:27,302 --> 00:07:28,466
And this boat, I'm the best.

116
00:07:28,526 --> 00:07:30,030
I never think I'm the best in...

117
00:07:31,093 --> 00:07:36,641
in goal, normal goal, but in that moment, I think I beat the other goalkeeper.

118
00:07:37,182 --> 00:07:39,474
you know, because it's five shooters.

119
00:07:39,936 --> 00:07:40,458
I think

120
00:07:41,121 --> 00:07:44,685
saving two, plus maybe three, you win the tie.

121
00:07:45,988 --> 00:07:48,460
And I always back myself to say one or two, you know.

122
00:07:49,764 --> 00:07:50,966
And that's how I go through it.

123
00:07:51,087 --> 00:07:53,272
Even if you score the first one, I'm still going to save two.

124
00:07:54,414 --> 00:07:56,303
If you score the second one, I'm still going to save two.

125
00:07:56,845 --> 00:07:58,111
So I'm mentally...

126
00:07:58,934 --> 00:08:00,516
really strong in those moments.

127
00:08:00,536 --> 00:08:03,861
For goalkeepers, that's the only moment maybe they got a little bit of pressure.

128
00:08:04,462 --> 00:08:10,416
because if they don't save the first two and they all keep at us, mentally they drop.

129
00:08:11,178 --> 00:08:17,585
So that's why I really pushed myself to save one in the first three, just to push the pressure on the other goalkeeper.

130
00:08:17,785 --> 00:08:23,063
I mean, it is a different sport, and you would probably Olympic gold if Penalty Shootout was an Olympic sport.

131
00:08:23,384 --> 00:08:29,694
But what I admire about you, Emi, is that you've turned psyching out other players almost into an art form.

132
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:35,146
Whether it's asking officials to check Kingsley Coman had put the ball on the right spot.

133
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:41,443
Asking Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes why his then-teammate Cristiano wasn't taking the penalty.

134
00:08:41,925 --> 00:08:46,496
or even shushing Lille supporters before a shootout in the Europa Conference League.

135
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:50,427
I mean, do you plan this kind of ***thousery in advance?

136
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,736
Or does it just happen in the moment?

137
00:08:52,796 --> 00:08:56,008
A reaction to the players, to the fans, to the match, to the moment?

138
00:08:56,289 --> 00:08:58,896
No, just at the moment, you know, I never plan anything.

139
00:08:59,517 --> 00:09:01,242
You know, when I say the first

140
00:09:02,224 --> 00:09:05,492
Then I tried to create a little bit of pressure on the players.

141
00:09:06,957 --> 00:09:08,303
But no more than that.

142
00:09:09,528 --> 00:09:12,191
people who do worse things and they get away with it.

143
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,795
But I miss a Conference League semi-final at home because

144
00:09:16,215 --> 00:09:19,641
the ref gave me a yellow for asking for a ball.

145
00:09:19,661 --> 00:09:21,444
So now I got a reputation that

146
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:25,091
that you know wind people up and that's not that's not correct

147
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:27,718
Two opponents, team supporters.

148
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,125
You have become your own kind of villain.

149
00:09:30,927 --> 00:09:32,893
You definitely do lean into that, Emi.

150
00:09:33,796 --> 00:09:36,684
Winding up opponents, winding up opposing fans...

151
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:40,703
It does feel sometimes that that can clash with the focus sometimes.

152
00:09:41,546 --> 00:09:44,296
the zone, the concentration that you need to repel

153
00:09:44,978 --> 00:09:45,600
all comers.

154
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,005
How would you balance the two in your own mind?

155
00:09:48,386 --> 00:09:51,393
Or do you draw strength from others' weaknesses?

156
00:09:51,934 --> 00:09:54,802
I just look at myself, I never look at the others.

157
00:09:56,246 --> 00:09:59,596
When I go onto the pitch or on a penalty shootout, I go and win it.

158
00:10:00,137 --> 00:10:00,879
That's all I care.

159
00:10:01,582 --> 00:10:04,952
I don't care what the fans say or the opponents or the managers.

160
00:10:06,296 --> 00:10:10,308
I just help my back four and I try to make as many saves as I can.

161
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:12,872
Last question for you, Emi Martinez.

162
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:16,357
This season, we're asking all of the players that we speak to,

163
00:10:16,918 --> 00:10:22,245
If you could only listen to one song for the rest of your life, what would it be and why?

164
00:10:22,645 --> 00:10:27,563
Tres estrellas en el conjunto, which is the Argentinian song after we win the World Cup.

165
00:10:29,524 --> 00:10:30,086
Thank you, mate.

166
00:10:30,467 --> 00:10:31,109
Big, big love.

167
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:31,811
Thanks, heavy.

168
00:10:31,891 --> 00:10:32,513
Thanks, Philip.

169
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:33,496
Courage.
