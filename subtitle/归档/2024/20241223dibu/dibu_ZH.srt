114
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:26,781

117
00:07:31,093 --> 00:07:36,641

在那些时刻真的很坚强。

127
00:08:00,536 --> 00:08:03,861
对于守门员来说，这可能是他们唯一感受到一点压力的时刻。

For goalkeepers, that's the only moment maybe they got a little bit of pressure.

128
00:08:04,462 --> 00:08:10,416

because if they don't save the first two and they all keep at us, mentally they drop.
because if they don't save the first two and they all keep at us, mentally they drop.

129
00:08:11,178 --> 00:08:17,585
所以这就是为什么我真的强迫自己在前三场比赛中扑出一个球，只是为了给另一名门将施加压力。
So that's why I really pushed myself to save one in the first three, just to push the pressure on the other goalkeeper.
