1
00:00:00,336 --> 00:00:02,261
Bombanero Anfield for atmosphere.

2
00:00:03,217 --> 00:00:04,420
No, come on.

3
00:00:05,182 --> 00:00:10,014
What was it like the morning that you got the news that Jurgen Klopp was going to walk away?

4
00:00:10,114 --> 00:00:10,855
the end of the season.

5
00:00:11,116 --> 00:00:12,378
I think everyone was in shock.

6
00:00:12,698 --> 00:00:13,440
Why is he leaving?

7
00:00:14,827 --> 00:00:15,591
The World Cup.

8
00:00:15,812 --> 00:00:17,983
Is there someone that knows about World Cup this year?

9
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:20,107
I don't know what it's like to win one though, Alexis.

10
00:00:20,167 --> 00:00:21,309
Could you please tell me?

11
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:23,292
Five million people on the streets.

12
00:00:23,772 --> 00:00:26,820
And people used to run next to the bus for kilometers.

13
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:30,569
That was the most special moment in my football career.

14
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:31,031
for sure.

15
00:00:33,154 --> 00:00:37,478
Trent Alexander-Arnold, Mo Salah, Virgil van Dijk, they're all obviously out of contract.

16
00:00:37,618 --> 00:00:39,399
Is that something that players talk about?

17
00:00:43,103 --> 00:00:45,946
I'm at the home of Alexis McAllister, who

18
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:50,182
as you'll all know is a World Cup winner currently playing in the

19
00:00:50,924 --> 00:00:53,971
all-conquering Liverpool side under Arne Slott.

20
00:00:54,232 --> 00:00:57,059
And I want to ask firstly, actually, about your name.

21
00:00:58,783 --> 00:01:03,375
Macalester now that's a kind of bit of British about that but certainly at least

22
00:01:04,016 --> 00:01:06,970
I'm Scottish about it or possibly Irish as well.

23
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:07,412
Yeah.

24
00:01:07,512 --> 00:01:08,174
It is Irish.

25
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:12,443
I don't know why many, many people think it's Scottish.

26
00:01:12,684 --> 00:01:13,265
Well, it's muck.

27
00:01:13,526 --> 00:01:14,428
Muck everything is muck.

28
00:01:14,588 --> 00:01:16,672
Yeah, it's actually Irish.

29
00:01:18,615 --> 00:01:20,579
And a couple of months or weeks ago,

30
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,263
and I received a letter from my family in Ireland.

31
00:01:25,964 --> 00:01:26,985
Asking you to play for them?

32
00:01:27,586 --> 00:01:28,770
No, no, that's too late.

33
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:29,572
That's too late.

34
00:01:29,612 --> 00:01:30,475
Yeah, that's too late.

35
00:01:30,535 --> 00:01:32,421
But asking me to go there one day.

36
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:36,399
yeah i would love to i would love to and it feels weird because

37
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:40,494
I'm 25 and it just came now.

38
00:01:42,262 --> 00:01:47,812
But hopefully, hopefully one day I can go and meet all of my family.

39
00:01:48,713 --> 00:01:52,619
Talking of family, you have a remarkable football family, don't you?

40
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:56,949
I mean, so many members that have gone on to have careers in football

41
00:01:58,613 --> 00:01:59,396
Talk to your family.

42
00:01:59,436 --> 00:01:59,977
Who's played?

43
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,324
Yeah, for us, football is everything.

44
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:04,650
You have my dad,

45
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:11,006
play football with Diego Maradona exactly so very lucky guy

46
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,233
So yeah, my dad and my uncle both play football.

47
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:18,235
Then my two brothers play football.

48
00:02:19,528 --> 00:02:24,478
Now one is playing in Belgium, the other one in Argentina, Francis and Kevin.

49
00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:27,022
So there you have four players.

50
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:31,309
Then one of my cousins is playing in Malaysia now, Luciano.

51
00:02:33,358 --> 00:02:35,206
and of course granddad's

52
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:39,175
play football as well, not professionally, but play football.

53
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:45,911
Yeah, football means everything to us and that's why we play and that's why we

54
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:50,547
we we really enjoy playing it you've got a kevin mcallister in the family

55
00:02:50,808 --> 00:02:52,212
Was it named after the Home Alone?

56
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:53,816
I'm sure you've been asked this before.

57
00:02:53,896 --> 00:02:54,517
It actually was.

58
00:02:54,918 --> 00:02:55,901
Yeah, it actually was.

59
00:02:56,983 --> 00:02:58,768
And he didn't know until he was 15 or 16.

60
00:03:00,072 --> 00:03:02,669
He was basically doing an interview and they asked him,

61
00:03:03,553 --> 00:03:08,580
And we were listening to it in the kitchen, and he was in the living room doing the interview.

62
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:11,163
So he said, no, I don't really know.

63
00:03:11,243 --> 00:03:12,104
I don't think so.

64
00:03:12,485 --> 00:03:14,768
And my mom was next to me and she was like,

65
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:18,764
yes it's because of the because of the film so it was it was

66
00:03:19,025 --> 00:03:25,671
quite a funny funny moment and but yeah when he was 16 he found out that it was because of the of

67
00:03:25,711 --> 00:03:27,035
There are worse things to find out.

68
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:29,984
What was it like growing up as a...

69
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:32,712
a youngster in Argentina.

70
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,477
I had the possibilities to

71
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,511
to go to different clubs and play football.

72
00:03:39,554 --> 00:03:44,969
and with my two brothers it was always easier because you have them to

73
00:03:45,531 --> 00:03:47,019
to play football whenever you want.

74
00:03:47,623 --> 00:03:49,171
You must have been playing growing up.

75
00:03:50,256 --> 00:03:52,705
Every day we really enjoy playing together.

76
00:03:53,447 --> 00:03:56,273
So, yeah, I started in Argentinos Juniors.

77
00:03:57,773 --> 00:04:01,184
a big club in Argentina where Maradona play.

78
00:04:01,847 --> 00:04:07,269
Players like Riquelme, Cambiasso, Sorin, big, big players play there.

79
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:10,959
So we decided to go, all of us there.

80
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,242
You mentioned Riquelme as well.

81
00:04:12,603 --> 00:04:18,017
I think he's widely regarded in Argentina as a very special player, wasn't he?

82
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,036
Yeah, for me, he was always my idol.

83
00:04:21,717 --> 00:04:22,459
I always said that.

84
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:24,343
He was an amazing player.

85
00:04:24,424 --> 00:04:25,185
He used to play as a 10.

86
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,219
Then he went to Barcelona where at

87
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:32,001
I think he didn't enjoy much.

88
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:35,966
We'll jump ahead to the World Cup, just briefly, just for this particular story.

89
00:04:37,048 --> 00:04:42,477
the old borough wasn't it borough um from from messi towards louis van gaal is it true that that

90
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:46,186
because also Messi had a lot of respect for Riquelme and didn't like the way he was treated.

91
00:04:46,246 --> 00:04:47,850
Is that generally the case?

92
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:49,654
And that's why he responded to that.

93
00:04:49,674 --> 00:04:50,295
I'm not sure.

94
00:04:50,395 --> 00:04:50,856
I'm not sure.

95
00:04:50,896 --> 00:04:52,459
I couldn't say I couldn't say that.

96
00:04:53,722 --> 00:04:57,453
What I know is that Messi and Riquelme have a very good relationship and of course,

97
00:04:57,895 --> 00:05:00,042
Riquelme didn't have a good time with Van Gaal.

98
00:05:00,563 --> 00:05:01,326
Di Maria neither.

99
00:05:03,593 --> 00:05:06,623
But... That game was...

100
00:05:08,004 --> 00:05:12,899
was a big one because I remember Dibu Martinez as well saying that

101
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:15,148
They spoke a lot before the game.

102
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,594
I don't know, it felt like...

103
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:18,759
They were not respecting us.

104
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:22,525
So yeah, it was a big game.

105
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:24,308
It was a nice one because we won it.

106
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:29,987
at the end in penalties it got a bit scary though didn't it yeah two goals right at the end and

107
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:35,490
And then the scenes in the dugout and the kind of bit of a fisticuffs and all that.

108
00:05:35,911 --> 00:05:39,743
It was similar to the final because we were winning 2-0.

109
00:05:40,024 --> 00:05:42,773
Without the aggressive nature between the two.

110
00:05:43,356 --> 00:05:44,661
Yeah, very similar to the final.

111
00:05:44,902 --> 00:05:48,096
So yeah, 2-0 and then they scored.

112
00:05:48,357 --> 00:05:52,105
two goals out of nothing, just with two crosses.

113
00:05:53,508 --> 00:05:54,730
Well, actually it was a free kick.

114
00:05:55,211 --> 00:05:55,913
Clever free kick, actually.

115
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:56,754
Yeah, it was a nice one.

116
00:05:56,975 --> 00:05:57,817
But yeah, after...

117
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:06,096
during the extra time I think we dominated the game again and won it on penalties but

118
00:06:06,818 --> 00:06:07,458
It was a nice one.

119
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:08,199
It felt nice.

120
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,142
It felt like a war on the beach.

121
00:06:10,622 --> 00:06:12,225
And as Argentinians, we really like it.

122
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:19,582
Talking about that nature of Argentinian football, what's the biggest difference between playing in Argentina and playing in England?

123
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:24,650
I went straight from Argentina to Brighton.

124
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,420
So for me it was a huge change.

125
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,022
In what way?

126
00:06:28,665 --> 00:06:31,497
I think that the most difficult part was the physical side.

127
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:34,144
here the intensity is too high.

128
00:06:34,385 --> 00:06:35,648
That would surprise people here because

129
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:42,539
I've played against Argentina on two or three occasions and one very famous game.

130
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,148
And the one thing I would have said is that they're very physical.

131
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:49,237
I mean, obviously brilliantly talented, but it always felt...

132
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:52,866
I played against Ruggieri and people like that, Brown.

133
00:06:53,508 --> 00:06:55,213
They were pretty physical, I can assure you.

134
00:06:55,253 --> 00:06:55,493
Is that...

135
00:06:56,656 --> 00:06:57,237
Not the case?

136
00:06:57,658 --> 00:07:01,322
The thing is, I think in Argentina it's more about the duels.

137
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:04,191
That's where we put the intensity.

138
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:06,197
And here is...

139
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:10,991
I don't know, the total distance you made, the highest sprint.

140
00:07:11,392 --> 00:07:12,615
I think that's the difference.

141
00:07:12,655 --> 00:07:14,119
Then when we go to deals, we go...

142
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,864
always 100%.

143
00:07:16,285 --> 00:07:16,846
We don't care.

144
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:21,357
So yeah, in Argentina it's more about tackles and these kind of things, but here the physical

145
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:25,244
Yeah, the running aspects, the speed of the game.

146
00:07:25,644 --> 00:07:27,548
Did it take you a while to adapt?

147
00:07:27,768 --> 00:07:28,772
Yeah, yeah, it did.

148
00:07:29,213 --> 00:07:31,963
I would say eight months to a year.

149
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:32,184
Yeah.

150
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:36,800
And when I arrived here, I didn't have...

151
00:07:38,706 --> 00:07:43,044
I don't know, the physical aspect was a big thing for me, but I arrived and...

152
00:07:43,686 --> 00:07:46,113
two or three weeks later, COVID started.

153
00:07:46,995 --> 00:07:48,239
So I didn't have...

154
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:54,256
the trainings I needed for, I would say two months because we couldn't train.

155
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:55,702
Was that difficult?

156
00:07:55,723 --> 00:07:57,270
Because I imagine, because...

157
00:07:58,535 --> 00:08:02,523
there's no fans, people had to be apart, and you've just come to a new country.

158
00:08:02,563 --> 00:08:03,405
That must have actually been,

159
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:04,508
That was so hard.

160
00:08:04,628 --> 00:08:05,610
That was so hard for me.

161
00:08:06,131 --> 00:08:09,758
And I was lucky because my mom was in England, so...

162
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:13,384
I had my mom and she used to cook and do all the things that

163
00:08:14,085 --> 00:08:15,711
At that time, I didn't know how to do it.

164
00:08:16,393 --> 00:08:16,774
So...

165
00:08:17,858 --> 00:08:19,023
That was a big thing.

166
00:08:19,927 --> 00:08:21,654
But yeah, it was a nice period.

167
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:25,410
when we're at home doing nothing, couldn't train.

168
00:08:25,991 --> 00:08:31,258
then the league started again and there was no fans didn't felt right but

169
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:32,843
It is what it is.

170
00:08:33,144 --> 00:08:35,455
After that, I think... Do you think that also affected your

171
00:08:35,555 --> 00:08:40,232
Argentinian career because you played a couple of games didn't you when you were very young and then there was COVID and then you

172
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:44,570
Didn't get back into the side until a year or so before the World Cup.

173
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,886
Yeah, and it was because of Cody, but as well because I couldn't,

174
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:55,388
uh get the game time i wanted here in england so as i said it took me

175
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,877
Like a year to play regularly.

176
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,911
Were there times you thought, I'm not sure I can do it here?

177
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:07,080
Well, there was a time that I was or actually when I started playing, I was about to leave.

178
00:09:08,277 --> 00:09:11,531
Basically, January was coming

179
00:09:12,674 --> 00:09:16,100
and you know December and January you have lots of games in the Premier League,

180
00:09:16,802 --> 00:09:20,356
So we had a lot of injuries in Brighton and...

181
00:09:21,138 --> 00:09:22,543
there was no option.

182
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:25,812
So the manager had to say, okay, Alexis, it's your turn.

183
00:09:25,872 --> 00:09:26,875
Was that Potter at that time?

184
00:09:27,176 --> 00:09:28,018
That was Potter, yeah.

185
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:32,044
So yeah, I had the possibility to play,

186
00:09:32,845 --> 00:09:34,910
a couple of games, score some goals.

187
00:09:35,672 --> 00:09:39,039
And I think the manager started

188
00:09:41,223 --> 00:09:44,027
like had more confidence on me from that time.

189
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:51,323
That was the moment where I started playing and I started feeling confident that I could

190
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:52,246
I could do it.

191
00:09:52,486 --> 00:09:53,268
I think it's difficult.

192
00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:56,015
I've played abroad as well in a couple of places and I think

193
00:09:56,636 --> 00:09:59,756
There's an automatic assumption that football playing, you just

194
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:05,504
you carry on the same everywhere you go, but it's not necessarily like that when you move in country to adapt different language.

195
00:10:05,524 --> 00:10:06,885
Did you speak English when you first arrived?

196
00:10:07,826 --> 00:10:12,550
Well, I must congratulate you on how you've managed to learn the language really well.

197
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,053
And that's important, isn't it?

198
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,519
To feel part of everything.

199
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:19,787
Because you feel a bit like an outsider when you can't understand what anyone else is saying.

200
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:20,490
Yeah.

201
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,514
Even on the football pitch.

202
00:10:21,876 --> 00:10:23,322
Yeah, it was so difficult.

203
00:10:23,342 --> 00:10:24,025
The language was...

204
00:10:24,446 --> 00:10:30,902
was a big thing for me and i did lessons for a year and a half and back to school

205
00:10:31,383 --> 00:10:32,366
Yes, basically.

206
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:34,210
It was good.

207
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:34,712
It was good.

208
00:10:35,153 --> 00:10:38,060
It's always nice to communicate and have relationships.

209
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:39,662
within the club.

210
00:10:41,104 --> 00:10:41,785
So language

211
00:10:42,085 --> 00:10:46,122
was was a big barrier at the at the beginning then the culture the weather

212
00:10:46,894 --> 00:10:49,399
The weather, isn't it?

213
00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:50,500
Yeah, it's beautiful.

214
00:10:50,521 --> 00:10:53,426
Especially at this time of year from now until about March.

215
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:59,017
So let's say that in Argentina is a bit different in terms of the weather.

216
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:03,103
But yeah, I had to learn a lot of things.

217
00:11:03,203 --> 00:11:04,385
As I said, I was young.

218
00:11:05,487 --> 00:11:07,531
I didn't know how to live on my own.

219
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,215
So...

220
00:11:10,217 --> 00:11:10,979
It was tough.

221
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,245
It was a tough year, but after that,

222
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:21,024
I love the country, the people, and I feel very welcome here in England.

223
00:11:21,687 --> 00:11:23,233
that's good to hear what's Graham Potter like?

224
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,378
he's a very good coach

225
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,046
coach that needs time to build things.

226
00:11:29,287 --> 00:11:30,509
Which you didn't get at Chelsea.

227
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:31,711
Yeah, exactly.

228
00:11:32,071 --> 00:11:35,096
And which is normal, you know, in the clubs, you don't have that.

229
00:11:35,497 --> 00:11:37,042
The time you need, it's always like this.

230
00:11:38,847 --> 00:11:39,369
And I felt...

231
00:11:39,971 --> 00:11:44,287
really sad for him because I know the coach he is, the human being he is.

232
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:51,633
Even though I didn't play the first year, I think he was always there to support me and that was

233
00:11:51,934 --> 00:11:57,303
really important so I'm really grateful with him and I think he's a very good coach that's

234
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,521
hopefully we will see him soon on the pitch

235
00:12:02,606 --> 00:12:04,874
It's a very well run club, Brighton, isn't it?

236
00:12:04,935 --> 00:12:06,881
Was that a good place to start?

237
00:12:07,283 --> 00:12:07,805
Definitely.

238
00:12:08,387 --> 00:12:09,551
Definitely.

239
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:10,755
What makes them so different?

240
00:12:10,795 --> 00:12:13,424
Because they're punching above their weight, realistically, aren't they?

241
00:12:13,585 --> 00:12:14,588
As a football club.

242
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:19,765
They seem to find players like yourself, young players coming through from different parts of the world,

243
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:24,229
and then sell them on or keep them as part of their team.

244
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,631
They don't make many mistakes.

245
00:12:27,051 --> 00:12:33,346
Well, I think everyone looks at the young players, the players they sell or these kind of things, but

246
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:39,165
What I have to say is that they have a big base in players like Louis Dank.

247
00:12:40,568 --> 00:12:44,715
These leaders that are so important for the club, Dani Welbeck,

248
00:12:45,115 --> 00:12:49,562
He's been there for a couple of years and he was amazing with the young players.

249
00:12:51,349 --> 00:12:53,557
Yeah, they bring players that

250
00:12:56,047 --> 00:12:58,155
They think they are good from the data.

251
00:12:58,295 --> 00:12:59,941
They work a lot with data.

252
00:13:00,824 --> 00:13:01,205
So...

253
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:07,268
Yeah, I think everyone at the club knows

254
00:13:10,236 --> 00:13:14,162
the role and I think, as I said, I think that

255
00:13:14,602 --> 00:13:21,279
the base that they created in Lewistown, of course, then you need the managers.

256
00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:23,403
to play the young players, which is not easy.

257
00:13:23,423 --> 00:13:26,388
They still seem to find the clever upcoming managers as well.

258
00:13:26,468 --> 00:13:27,269
Yeah, exactly.

259
00:13:27,951 --> 00:13:32,258
After Porto, they found the Serbi, which... What was he like?

260
00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:35,943
He's quite frantic, quite passionate.

261
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:36,904
Yeah, he's Italian.

262
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:37,585
He's Italian.

263
00:13:37,745 --> 00:13:43,379
he's a crazy guy he's a crazy guy i love him i love him i think he's the best manager i've ever had

264
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,061
Really?

265
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:44,401
Yeah.

266
00:13:44,461 --> 00:13:47,566
And then I have coaches like Heinz as well in Argentina.

267
00:13:48,507 --> 00:13:51,276
And so I have very good coaches.

268
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,664
What makes the Zerbi so special?

269
00:13:54,106 --> 00:13:58,206
I think the passion he gives for football.

270
00:13:59,807 --> 00:14:05,761
That's special and then his idea, his tactical side is amazing.

271
00:14:07,225 --> 00:14:12,004
I don't know how to say it, but he makes your selfies.

272
00:14:12,526 --> 00:14:14,169
feel good in the team.

273
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:15,852
Good motivation.

274
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:22,754
Yeah, so since the first day I met him, he was amazing with me and that's why I said he was the best coach.

275
00:14:23,055 --> 00:14:24,963
When you go back to Brighton, how are the fans with you?

276
00:14:25,506 --> 00:14:25,928
Amazing.

277
00:14:25,988 --> 00:14:26,349
They're good?

278
00:14:26,731 --> 00:14:28,256
They appreciate what you did for them.

279
00:14:28,357 --> 00:14:30,565
I came back twice with Liverpool and...

280
00:14:31,468 --> 00:14:33,574
They've always been amazing with me.

281
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,102
They know that the love I have for them.

282
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:41,575
And yeah, it's a really special place for me.

283
00:14:41,816 --> 00:14:44,864
And they probably understand if a club like Liverpool comes calling.

284
00:14:45,707 --> 00:14:47,334
It's tough to turn that down, isn't it?

285
00:14:47,656 --> 00:14:48,821
What was that like when you got...

286
00:14:49,523 --> 00:14:49,844
I don't know.

287
00:14:50,024 --> 00:14:50,705
How did it happen?

288
00:14:50,986 --> 00:14:51,867
Did you get a call?

289
00:14:51,948 --> 00:14:53,570
Did your agent get in touch with you?

290
00:14:53,651 --> 00:14:55,454
Did the club say, well, we've had an offer?

291
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:56,035
How did it work?

292
00:14:56,256 --> 00:14:57,710
Yeah, it was with my agent first.

293
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:02,868
Of course, you said Liverpool is a big club, so it's so hard to say no.

294
00:15:03,609 --> 00:15:04,669
But at the same time, there was

295
00:15:05,491 --> 00:15:08,484
I released Glow, so everything was a little bit easier, let's say.

296
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:15,265
And I don't think the fans understand that Liverpool comes and is

297
00:15:16,556 --> 00:15:21,445
It's a big club because it happened with players that went to Chelsea or...

298
00:15:22,347 --> 00:15:24,795
other clubs and the fans don't like it.

299
00:15:25,437 --> 00:15:26,962
I think it's just the way you live, you know?

300
00:15:26,982 --> 00:15:28,948
Well, fans never like it when their best players go.

301
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:32,402
I mean, you can understand that, can't you?

302
00:15:32,602 --> 00:15:33,566
As a footballer, I think...

303
00:15:34,429 --> 00:15:40,654
But sometimes players leave in a certain way that makes it uncomfortable for them to go back, but that didn't happen with

304
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:41,500
Yeah, exactly.

305
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,063
I think it's the way you live, you know.

306
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:47,170
As I said, there was a release clause and for me it was easier for the club.

307
00:15:49,297 --> 00:15:50,861
But I always respect them.

308
00:15:51,904 --> 00:15:56,651
And that's the most important thing because I'm really grateful with them and that's why I've done it.

309
00:15:58,617 --> 00:16:01,528
as I say I have big love for them

310
00:16:02,933 --> 00:16:06,678
I spent three years and a half there, so really grateful for them.

311
00:16:06,738 --> 00:16:08,920
And I didn't want to live in a bad way.

312
00:16:09,982 --> 00:16:11,566
I think it was the best for everyone.

313
00:16:11,586 --> 00:16:13,992
What was it like walking through the doors at Anfield?

314
00:16:15,355 --> 00:16:20,068
So special, so special because it's a big club.

315
00:16:21,974 --> 00:16:23,507
And you've been at La Bombonera?

316
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,992
I was going to ask you actually, that was one of my questions that I got planned in my head was Bombanero or Anfield for atmosphere?

317
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:31,962
Nah, come on.

318
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:37,623
I went there with Diego Maradona, you may have heard of him.

319
00:16:39,146 --> 00:16:42,501
It was the most unbelievable atmosphere.

320
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:42,984
I mean, they...

321
00:16:43,606 --> 00:16:47,739
nuts man as was Diego he was trying to hang over the balcony bizarre but

322
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,243
Yes, it's crazy.

323
00:16:49,263 --> 00:16:49,685
It's crazy.

324
00:16:49,765 --> 00:16:51,791
And I think they're different.

325
00:16:52,493 --> 00:16:53,275
Both are amazing.

326
00:16:54,998 --> 00:16:58,963
And I think in Europe, Liverpool's fans are the best.

327
00:16:59,804 --> 00:17:01,709
And I'm not saying it because I play for Liverpool.

328
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:06,481
I know it's hard to understand it, but I think they are the best or one of the best.

329
00:17:07,303 --> 00:17:12,977
but in Argentina everything is different because in Argentina we are used to sing

330
00:17:13,918 --> 00:17:16,141
songs like the whole game.

331
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:19,985
So it creates something different, whether here I think it's more

332
00:17:21,971 --> 00:17:24,340
a reactive thing from the fans.

333
00:17:25,063 --> 00:17:28,076
when you're going well they start getting there or sometimes when you're struggling they

334
00:17:28,377 --> 00:17:29,038
Yeah, exactly.

335
00:17:29,098 --> 00:17:32,783
It depends what is happening during the game and in Argentina it's different.

336
00:17:33,564 --> 00:17:38,852
But yeah, it's so hard because at the same time, I support Boca Juniors since I was a kid.

337
00:17:39,974 --> 00:17:43,987
yeah those nights under the lights at Anfield um

338
00:17:44,087 --> 00:17:50,432
particularly perhaps in, say, a second leg of how it used to be, well, it will be in the knockout stages of a Champions League game.

339
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:52,334
That must be something else.

340
00:17:52,715 --> 00:17:56,502
Even if it's just a Premier League game, but that thing when you walk out, the lights are on, they're all...

341
00:17:57,084 --> 00:17:58,129
You never walk alone.

342
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:01,825
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to a second leg of Champions League.

343
00:18:03,191 --> 00:18:06,747
Given how you started in the Champions League, I think you might get one.

344
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:12,222
hopefully hopefully hopefully yeah but yeah under the light is easy

345
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:17,213
I don't know if it's magic the other day against Real Madrid or when you have big games

346
00:18:18,455 --> 00:18:21,579
you could hit them and they are really behind us.

347
00:18:23,082 --> 00:18:29,014
I think they know that we need them and that's so important to create that connection between fans and

348
00:18:29,796 --> 00:18:36,171
and the team, so yeah, I really love them and really looking forward for that second leg

349
00:18:36,271 --> 00:18:37,616
in the Champions League, hopefully.

350
00:18:38,198 --> 00:18:39,041
I'm sure you will.

351
00:18:39,482 --> 00:18:40,305
It'd be amazing.

352
00:18:40,988 --> 00:18:43,319
You started under Jurgen Klopp, now you've got Arne Schlott.

353
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,055
Firstly, Jurgen Klopp, what was he?

354
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:51,551
I mean, we all see him, he's got that incredible enthusiasm as well, a little bit like Deservey, but...

355
00:18:52,494 --> 00:18:54,778
and did an amazing job there over a long period of time.

356
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:55,800
What was he like to play for?

357
00:18:56,161 --> 00:18:57,704
He was amazing from the first day.

358
00:18:59,186 --> 00:19:03,471
or actually before I signed for Liverpool I had a call with him and

359
00:19:05,173 --> 00:19:10,423
I don't know, since that moment I could feel that we were going to do

360
00:19:10,543 --> 00:19:15,113
great things and I really enjoyed my time with him.

361
00:19:15,293 --> 00:19:21,441
did he try and sell the club to you did he sell himself to you or how did he he didn't need to

362
00:19:22,643 --> 00:19:23,224
Well, I know.

363
00:19:23,945 --> 00:19:25,989
I suppose you'd heard of him.

364
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:31,704
But, yeah, I just want to know what he said to you, really, to entice you to – he probably didn't need to say much –

365
00:19:32,245 --> 00:19:36,654
But you probably wanted assurances that you really, you know, you were going to play.

366
00:19:37,655 --> 00:19:41,080
No, basically he said that there was going to be

367
00:19:42,321 --> 00:19:46,146
a change in terms of midfielders for the team.

368
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,823
he wanted me to be part of it and

369
00:19:50,305 --> 00:19:56,290
and he compared me with players like Gundogan, for example, that he managed in Dortmund.

370
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:02,562
He said that we had similar things and that I could be an important player for

371
00:20:03,264 --> 00:20:05,211
for Liverpool and for his team.

372
00:20:05,331 --> 00:20:05,833
So...

373
00:20:07,318 --> 00:20:11,085
That was enough to say I need to go there because

374
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:17,723
I was in a moment where I won the World Cup just six months ago.

375
00:20:19,129 --> 00:20:22,845
I wanted to go to a club that I had the opportunity to win trophies.

376
00:20:25,499 --> 00:20:26,244
And I wanted...

377
00:20:27,068 --> 00:20:31,398
to go to a club where I could feel important, you know, where I could feel that

378
00:20:33,582 --> 00:20:37,046
I could have a history there.

379
00:20:39,689 --> 00:20:44,829
Yeah, that was enough to tell myself that I wanted to play for Liverpool.

380
00:20:45,009 --> 00:20:48,559
As a coach and as a person, what was he like to play for?

381
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,362
Demanding or?

382
00:20:49,577 --> 00:20:51,442
Yeah, very demanding, very demanding.

383
00:20:53,087 --> 00:20:53,989
Was a human being.

384
00:20:54,471 --> 00:20:55,092
He's amazing.

385
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:55,333
And I...

386
00:20:56,115 --> 00:21:00,996
I think it's hard when you are a coach or when you are a player to see that

387
00:21:01,898 --> 00:21:02,499
that part.

388
00:21:03,741 --> 00:21:07,406
But I think when you are a good human being, then everything is easier.

389
00:21:08,747 --> 00:21:09,809
And he was very honest.

390
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,138
Every time he needed to say the truth, he said it.

391
00:21:14,418 --> 00:21:17,044
So that's a really important thing for me.

392
00:21:17,164 --> 00:21:20,049
And he was always there for me to support me because

393
00:21:20,971 --> 00:21:27,364
I remember at the beginning, we didn't have a six, so I had to start the season with

394
00:21:27,765 --> 00:21:28,508
playing as a six.

395
00:21:28,949 --> 00:21:29,792
Where do you like to play?

396
00:21:29,812 --> 00:21:31,096
What's your favorite role?

397
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,754
uh it's hard for me to say it but i like to be

398
00:21:36,155 --> 00:21:36,656
in the middle.

399
00:21:37,778 --> 00:21:40,523
If I'm in contact with the ball, then I'm happy.

400
00:21:42,731 --> 00:21:45,823
So, yeah, I started as a six last season and...

401
00:21:47,108 --> 00:21:52,821
People used to complain or criticize a little bit, and he was always there to support me.

402
00:21:53,543 --> 00:21:57,677
and defend me, so that was the most important thing for me.

403
00:21:58,132 --> 00:22:03,646
What was it like the morning or afternoon, whenever it was that you got the news that

404
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:08,531
Jurgen Klopp was going to walk away at the end of the season he was crazy because he'd not been there that long

405
00:22:09,131 --> 00:22:12,135
No, and it was crazy because we didn't know anything and...

406
00:22:13,857 --> 00:22:16,863
There was a day where I went to training and

407
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,630
Normally report used to be 1030, 1045

408
00:22:22,378 --> 00:22:26,006
And when I was on my way to a training ground,

409
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:29,073
We received a message that we had a meeting at 10.30.

410
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:31,277
So it was quite weird.

411
00:22:33,242 --> 00:22:39,638
And when I got to the training ground, I'm next to Salah in the dressing room, so I asked him,

412
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:40,781
What's going on?

413
00:22:42,046 --> 00:22:43,752
And he said the manager is leaving

414
00:22:44,013 --> 00:22:44,293
Really?

415
00:22:44,353 --> 00:22:45,614
You got the news from Mo Salah?

416
00:22:45,634 --> 00:22:46,755
From Mo Salah, yeah.

417
00:22:46,895 --> 00:22:48,076
And he was a surprise.

418
00:22:48,096 --> 00:22:49,677
First assist he's done for you, probably.

419
00:22:50,478 --> 00:22:51,299
Probably not the first.

420
00:22:52,221 --> 00:22:55,145
But it was a surprise because no one expected it.

421
00:22:57,088 --> 00:23:00,933
I think at that time we were first or second in the league, so it was a good moment.

422
00:23:00,973 --> 00:23:02,855
So there was no reason to leave.

423
00:23:04,878 --> 00:23:07,060
But yeah, we had a meeting, basically he...

424
00:23:09,122 --> 00:23:12,530
explain or he said that he was living and

425
00:23:13,171 --> 00:23:14,733
We just had to accept it.

426
00:23:14,913 --> 00:23:15,774
What was the mood like?

427
00:23:15,974 --> 00:23:18,437
I think everyone was in shock because no one expected it.

428
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:20,645
That was the main thing.

429
00:23:22,271 --> 00:23:22,974
Why is he leaving?

430
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,323
But we understand that it was his decision.

431
00:23:26,383 --> 00:23:27,866
We really respected it.

432
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,802
and he earned the right to do whatever he wanted.

433
00:23:33,513 --> 00:23:36,145
But we understood straight away that

434
00:23:38,675 --> 00:23:40,777
we had to finish the season in a good way.

435
00:23:40,797 --> 00:23:42,018
Do you think it affected you though?

436
00:23:42,038 --> 00:23:44,920
Because you kind of went off the ball towards the end, but you did have injuries.

437
00:23:45,181 --> 00:23:46,876
I don't think it affected us.

438
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:47,602
No.

439
00:23:48,702 --> 00:23:50,369
No.

440
00:23:51,394 --> 00:23:52,198
Maybe that could be the

441
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:57,677
excuse and we could blame him but I don't think that affected us and

442
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:02,825
we just ran out of energy at the end and

443
00:24:03,326 --> 00:24:08,112
When you compete against teams like Arsenal and City, you have to be at your best.

444
00:24:09,794 --> 00:24:13,359
No, I don't think Jurgen's departure affected us

445
00:24:14,982 --> 00:24:17,707
But, of course, it was a surprise for everyone.

446
00:24:18,108 --> 00:24:19,811
Alexis, you've got a new manager.

447
00:24:21,094 --> 00:24:22,779
Arnishlock, what a start he's made.

448
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,106
Because it must have been incredibly difficult.

449
00:24:25,848 --> 00:24:29,640
fill in the boots of Jurgen Klopp because he's been so dominant at the football club

450
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:36,888
and so impactful at the football club and so successful at the football club that to follow in his footsteps, but boy, what a start.

451
00:24:37,574 --> 00:24:41,669
Yeah, I think everyone thought that it was going to be difficult, but not Arne.

452
00:24:42,011 --> 00:24:43,075
Not Arne, I think...

453
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:47,323
since the first day he was he was really clear with the things he wanted and

454
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:49,435
On and off the pitch.

455
00:24:49,536 --> 00:24:51,045
Did he make an impact immediately?

456
00:24:51,507 --> 00:24:53,274
Yeah, I would say immediately.

457
00:24:53,314 --> 00:24:56,949
I mean, I was in preseason because of course I had...

458
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,113
international break after the season.

459
00:24:59,173 --> 00:25:01,316
So we had a couple of days off.

460
00:25:01,576 --> 00:25:04,181
But when I arrived to America,

461
00:25:05,824 --> 00:25:09,189
I could hear the boys and they were so happy with Arne.

462
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:15,628
They said it was quite different, especially in possession.

463
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,132
Tell us how.

464
00:25:17,533 --> 00:25:20,982
I mean, we've had our opinions on this podcast with Alan and Micah.

465
00:25:21,924 --> 00:25:23,386
that he seems to slow things down.

466
00:25:23,487 --> 00:25:24,088
No, definitely.

467
00:25:24,628 --> 00:25:27,693
It's a mix of the old and certainly something of the new.

468
00:25:28,616 --> 00:25:33,395
and kind of rotating in midfield and there seems to be a bit more patience

469
00:25:34,037 --> 00:25:36,741
slightly more thoughtful defensively.

470
00:25:36,821 --> 00:25:37,442
Would that be right?

471
00:25:37,682 --> 00:25:38,365
Tell us what you think.

472
00:25:38,385 --> 00:25:42,080
Yeah, I think the main thing is in possession we are more patient.

473
00:25:43,664 --> 00:25:45,128
Defensively, I would say

474
00:25:46,592 --> 00:25:49,159
similar to what we used to do with Jurgen.

475
00:25:51,989 --> 00:25:54,537
It depends on the other team as well.

476
00:25:56,865 --> 00:26:01,563
So we changed a lot the pressing in terms of the other team.

477
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:05,685
I think the main thing is in possession.

478
00:26:06,388 --> 00:26:11,185
where we are more patient, we have different patterns and different movements to

479
00:26:12,068 --> 00:26:17,447
to understand where the spaces are and try to exploit them.

480
00:26:19,434 --> 00:26:21,621
And I think we are still getting into the idea.

481
00:26:21,722 --> 00:26:24,411
Do you think he's more of a perhaps tactical coach?

482
00:26:24,732 --> 00:26:29,330
than than Clock because Clock was about passion wasn't it high energy Gagin press and yeah

483
00:26:29,792 --> 00:26:31,118
Yeah, for sure.

484
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:33,489
That's the main difference, the tactical side.

485
00:26:36,196 --> 00:26:40,084
As I said, I think it's about finding the free man or the space.

486
00:26:40,805 --> 00:26:45,478
and try to attack it and be more patient when you have the ball.

487
00:26:47,045 --> 00:26:47,809
Does it suit you?

488
00:26:48,352 --> 00:26:49,859
Yeah, for sure.

489
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:50,462
I would say so.

490
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:54,007
And yeah, for me, it's different as well because it's a different position.

491
00:26:55,188 --> 00:26:59,017
We spoke before that last season I played as a six.

492
00:27:00,962 --> 00:27:07,149
and now it's more double six or sometimes I could even play as an eight or ten, whatever you want to call it.

493
00:27:08,412 --> 00:27:13,166
Have you always had that ability to be versatile within that midfield role?

494
00:27:13,206 --> 00:27:14,129
Or have you learnt it?

495
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:14,933
No, I learned.

496
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:15,516
I learned.

497
00:27:17,425 --> 00:27:18,350
I started playing as a 10.

498
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:25,722
In Argentina, normally the system is four, two, three, one, so I used to play before

499
00:27:25,903 --> 00:27:30,684
behind the nine and used to be more of an attacker.

500
00:27:33,007 --> 00:27:34,868
It changed when I arrived to Brighton.

501
00:27:37,251 --> 00:27:42,148
And since that moment, I think I learned and understood the game a little bit more.

502
00:27:42,831 --> 00:27:46,263
And that's what I try every single day, try to understand.

503
00:27:47,306 --> 00:27:50,273
positions or the spaces I need to

504
00:27:51,215 --> 00:27:52,797
to attack on this kind of thing.

505
00:27:53,197 --> 00:27:55,619
So yeah, it's something that I learned and I think it's

506
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,391
It's really important to a player.

507
00:27:58,552 --> 00:27:59,094
I spoke to...

508
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:05,927
Rodri last week, who's also on the podcast, and he was saying similar things that he thinks about his position a lot.

509
00:28:06,047 --> 00:28:11,761
He talks about playing the position a lot and also he watches all the games back.

510
00:28:11,781 --> 00:28:12,844
Do you watch your games?

511
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:13,786
Not really.

512
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:19,439
I used to do it, but now that we have a lot of games, sometimes you need...

513
00:28:20,321 --> 00:28:22,048
the time to relax as well.

514
00:28:25,099 --> 00:28:28,473
But no, I don't really watch the games back.

515
00:28:29,577 --> 00:28:32,448
I don't think it's necessary because at the club we have everything.

516
00:28:33,502 --> 00:28:36,847
normally the day after or two days after we watch the

517
00:28:37,989 --> 00:28:41,012
some of the things that we need to improve so

518
00:28:42,296 --> 00:28:44,825
If I have time I do it, but not very often.

519
00:28:45,147 --> 00:28:48,380
Are you surprised of how well Liverpool have started?

520
00:28:48,802 --> 00:28:54,325
given the fact that they had a new man in charge, even though you could immediately tell that he knew what he was doing.

521
00:28:54,586 --> 00:28:58,078
yeah for sure for sure and i said it the other day like um

522
00:28:59,824 --> 00:29:03,070
I didn't expect us to be in the place we are now because

523
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:05,897
because I think we are in a transition.

524
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,406
As we spoke before, from Jurgen to Arne,

525
00:29:10,188 --> 00:29:13,516
new ideas, different things.

526
00:29:14,157 --> 00:29:16,643
But I think the team got it quite quickly.

527
00:29:17,745 --> 00:29:18,928
And we really like the idea.

528
00:29:18,968 --> 00:29:24,041
So we enjoy playing this football and I think that's why we are in the place we are.

529
00:29:24,321 --> 00:29:27,246
You mentioned that sometimes you play as two number sixes and there's an eight.

530
00:29:28,888 --> 00:29:29,811
kind of switch around.

531
00:29:30,433 --> 00:29:32,640
It's mainly been Gravenberg, yourself,

532
00:29:33,602 --> 00:29:35,004
and Curtis Jones, hasn't it?

533
00:29:35,124 --> 00:29:36,465
How does that work?

534
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:37,886
That new midfield, if you like.

535
00:29:38,488 --> 00:29:39,495
How have you felt in it?

536
00:29:39,616 --> 00:29:40,704
Does it feel comfortable now?

537
00:29:41,437 --> 00:29:44,985
Yeah, for me it feels very good, and I think for the other guys as well.

538
00:29:45,426 --> 00:29:47,671
But yeah, we have the freedom to do whatever we want.

539
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:51,704
sometimes, because sometimes it's about staying in your place as well

540
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,412
and as I said before, spaces and these kind of things.

541
00:29:58,377 --> 00:30:03,333
but at the same time we have the freedom to do whatever we want and we do have players like Ryan

542
00:30:03,473 --> 00:30:06,458
Curtis, Dom, Endo, Harvey.

543
00:30:06,879 --> 00:30:09,003
We have a lot of good midfielders.

544
00:30:09,985 --> 00:30:12,015
You have to give them that freedom.

545
00:30:14,042 --> 00:30:19,374
It feels really, really good because you can have that connection and those little passes

546
00:30:19,856 --> 00:30:23,074
between us and you will like it.

547
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,395
I always think midfielders, it's very important for them to have a leader behind them.

548
00:30:29,237 --> 00:30:30,301
And in Virgil van Dijk,

549
00:30:31,618 --> 00:30:32,723
How much of a leader is he?

550
00:30:32,743 --> 00:30:33,907
Is he vocal on the pitch?

551
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:34,850
Yeah.

552
00:30:35,031 --> 00:30:41,560
speaks a lot yeah but that's good that's good yeah because you need you need players like that

553
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,748
And he leads by the example.

554
00:30:46,951 --> 00:30:52,283
He's one of the leaders with Moe, with Robbo, Allison we have.

555
00:30:53,425 --> 00:30:58,354
experienced players that really help us to be better players.

556
00:30:59,336 --> 00:31:01,061
And then they are so important because

557
00:31:02,148 --> 00:31:04,090
For example, the game against Southampton.

558
00:31:04,391 --> 00:31:06,313
It wasn't a good game from us.

559
00:31:06,917 --> 00:31:08,671
We were struggling a little bit, losing 2-1.

560
00:31:10,475 --> 00:31:13,763
And that's the moment when you need players to step up.

561
00:31:14,084 --> 00:31:16,831
And that was the meeting at halftime where the manager said,

562
00:31:17,914 --> 00:31:20,586
now I want to see the players to step up and

563
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:26,625
That was Virgil and Ansala playing an amazing second half.

564
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:29,319
That's why you need them.

565
00:31:29,701 --> 00:31:30,063
They are...

566
00:31:31,731 --> 00:31:36,696
good people, they help you if you need and then on the pitch they do the work.

567
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,572
You knew I was going to ask you about Mo Salah.

568
00:31:39,975 --> 00:31:40,237
I mean...

569
00:31:42,502 --> 00:31:43,325
Incredible player.

570
00:31:43,867 --> 00:31:44,890
He's done it for so long.

571
00:31:44,931 --> 00:31:48,844
He's so consistent, even on the days where it's perhaps not working for him, he'll end up with a

572
00:31:49,145 --> 00:31:55,941
a goal from somewhere or even an assist what's he like I mean you sit right next to him you said in the dressing room we all know what he's like as a player

573
00:31:57,106 --> 00:31:59,135
What's it like as a person?

574
00:31:59,597 --> 00:32:03,288
Yeah, first thing, consistency is key, and he showed it.

575
00:32:04,992 --> 00:32:09,340
amazing and when you have him you know that he's gonna deliver and get the goals and assists and

576
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,252
that you need, so that's why he's so important.

577
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:18,168
And then off the pitch he demands a lot from

578
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,257
from him and from his teammates.

579
00:32:23,283 --> 00:32:27,987
So since I arrived to Liverpool, I think I changed a little bit my routine.

580
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:33,370
before I didn't used to go to the gym as much as now.

581
00:32:34,373 --> 00:32:35,295
And that's because of him.

582
00:32:37,219 --> 00:32:39,945
Is that because you were changing next to him and he had better abs than you?

583
00:32:40,768 --> 00:32:42,274
Or is it more for your football?

584
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:43,499
Yeah, that's one.

585
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,675
thing but the other thing is that he tells you that you need to be professional you need to go to a gym and

586
00:32:50,276 --> 00:32:51,257
or do this kind of thing.

587
00:32:51,297 --> 00:32:55,322
So, yeah, it's a pleasure to work with him and

588
00:32:56,684 --> 00:32:59,729
I think he really helps the players around.

589
00:33:00,629 --> 00:33:05,445
I want to actually, for no particular reason other than he's one of my favourite footballers, Trent Alexander-Arnold.

590
00:33:06,007 --> 00:33:11,313
Because technically, the passer of the ball, I think he's extraordinary.

591
00:33:11,433 --> 00:33:11,913
Yeah, I think...

592
00:33:12,694 --> 00:33:16,381
Everyone can see the quality like he's amazing on the ball and

593
00:33:17,143 --> 00:33:19,958
I know there was a lot of talking about his defensive side.

594
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:22,450
But I think he's amazing as well.

595
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:23,333
So defend that.

596
00:33:23,916 --> 00:33:24,899
There's a reason I asked you.

597
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,463
A little bit about those three.

598
00:33:26,523 --> 00:33:29,230
Trent Alexander-Arnold, Mo Salah, Virgil van Dijk.

599
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,795
They're all obviously out of contract at the end of the season.

600
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,451
Is that something that players talk about in the dressing room because

601
00:33:37,538 --> 00:33:39,108
you'd want them to stay, wouldn't you?

602
00:33:39,454 --> 00:33:43,431
Yeah, of course, there is a lot of jokes, let's say, but...

603
00:33:44,113 --> 00:33:49,765
At the end, it's a personal thing and we are going to respect the club and him and them.

604
00:33:51,471 --> 00:33:56,366
in whatever decision they they make of course we want them to to stay with us but

605
00:33:57,108 --> 00:34:02,169
As I said, it's a personal decision and I would never get there.

606
00:34:03,212 --> 00:34:05,776
Do you think you can go on to win the league this season?

607
00:34:05,796 --> 00:34:08,441
It's too early, probably, but it's great to have a lead, isn't it?

608
00:34:08,601 --> 00:34:12,796
Yeah, it is early, but we have a nice difference now.

609
00:34:14,482 --> 00:34:14,864
So...

610
00:34:16,601 --> 00:34:17,865
Yeah, it is possible, of course.

611
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:20,694
And we are there, we are candidates, let's say.

612
00:34:21,335 --> 00:34:23,400
But we need to keep going because it's too early.

613
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,665
There's many, many games to come.

614
00:34:26,266 --> 00:34:27,547
have Champions League as well.

615
00:34:27,567 --> 00:34:30,551
So, yeah, we need to keep working.

616
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:37,331
keep getting into Arne's idea because I think we have a lot of things to improve.

617
00:34:38,413 --> 00:34:41,741
yet but we are in a good way to woke up

618
00:34:43,345 --> 00:34:44,146
The World Cup.

619
00:34:44,247 --> 00:34:46,430
If there is someone that knows about World Cup, it's you.

620
00:34:47,092 --> 00:34:49,044
I don't know what it's like to win one though, Alexis.

621
00:34:49,084 --> 00:34:50,231
Could you please tell me?

622
00:34:53,856 --> 00:34:54,338
I don't know.

623
00:34:54,378 --> 00:34:56,307
I mean, it's magical.

624
00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:58,135
It's so special.

625
00:34:58,155 --> 00:34:58,376
Like,

626
00:35:00,276 --> 00:35:01,420
I think we are still

627
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:10,116
realizing what it means because it's something that's it's not easy and

628
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,638
I don't know, the most important thing for me was

629
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:20,152
when we went back to Argentina and you could see people's faces.

630
00:35:20,834 --> 00:35:21,957
That was so, so special.

631
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,221
Millions of people out in the street.

632
00:35:24,241 --> 00:35:27,986
There was 5 million people in the streets and we went with the bus and

633
00:35:28,757 --> 00:35:32,647
And people used to run next to the bus for kilometers.

634
00:35:33,469 --> 00:35:37,876
So you could see people crying, smiling, saying a lot of things.

635
00:35:38,798 --> 00:35:43,758
That was the most special moment in my football career, for sure.

636
00:35:43,999 --> 00:35:47,325
And also I think it added to it because I think apart from

637
00:35:47,726 --> 00:35:51,543
obviously France fans and perhaps some Ronaldo supporters,

638
00:35:52,085 --> 00:35:55,405
I think the rest of the world really wanted Argentina to win it.

639
00:35:56,311 --> 00:35:58,237
because of Messi.

640
00:35:58,337 --> 00:36:00,182
Did it feel like that for the players?

641
00:36:00,202 --> 00:36:02,689
Did it feel like you wanted, not just for yourselves,

642
00:36:03,311 --> 00:36:06,118
but for him, because it was the one thing that was perhaps missing.

643
00:36:06,178 --> 00:36:06,760
Yeah, for sure.

644
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,744
I think everyone that shared...

645
00:36:09,586 --> 00:36:12,770
dressing room with Lionel wanting him to

646
00:36:13,493 --> 00:36:14,379
to win this World Cup.

647
00:36:15,385 --> 00:36:16,955
It was a special occasion and

648
00:36:18,462 --> 00:36:18,984
He's the best.

649
00:36:19,224 --> 00:36:21,070
He's the best footballer ever.

650
00:36:21,952 --> 00:36:22,735
I don't disagree.

651
00:36:22,996 --> 00:36:26,835
I mean, I obviously played against Diego a few times and I never thought

652
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:31,110
I never thought I'd ever say that there was a better player than Diego Maradona.

653
00:36:31,873 --> 00:36:34,261
I think ability-wise, almost the same.

654
00:36:35,024 --> 00:36:36,148
Amazingly similar.

655
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:42,818
But you have to give it to the longevity and you have to say that Diego had his issues.

656
00:36:43,038 --> 00:36:45,207
which affected his career, whereas Messi's not.

657
00:36:45,247 --> 00:36:48,239
But we all know how great he was as a player.

658
00:36:48,701 --> 00:36:50,610
And you agree with me that it's the best of all time.

659
00:36:52,042 --> 00:36:55,207
His leadership perhaps surprised a few people.

660
00:36:55,227 --> 00:36:58,132
We've all seen the interview perhaps before the Copa America game

661
00:36:58,613 --> 00:36:59,255
in Brazil.

662
00:36:59,355 --> 00:37:04,086
And I assume it was probably a similar thing in the World Cup.

663
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:06,875
He really came out, didn't he, as a leader?

664
00:37:07,597 --> 00:37:10,226
Yeah, I think he received a lot of...

665
00:37:10,808 --> 00:37:16,717
criticism from from fans in Argentina how tough was that for him do you think I think it was tough

666
00:37:17,498 --> 00:37:22,648
I think he never shows it, but it was tough because

667
00:37:23,711 --> 00:37:26,100
He gave everything for the national team.

668
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,947
He gave everything for his country.

669
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,582
And he got to finals that he couldn't win.

670
00:37:33,887 --> 00:37:37,914
and when you are the best player of course you get the criticism but

671
00:37:38,871 --> 00:37:39,636
He was always there.

672
00:37:39,817 --> 00:37:41,728
He kept going, kept going, kept going.

673
00:37:41,788 --> 00:37:42,915
And at the end he was.

674
00:37:43,096 --> 00:37:45,831
he got the work, but in terms of leadership, I think he,

675
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:52,182
He improved it a lot, like he grew into that and he's an amazing leader for us.

676
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:56,730
He doesn't speak much, but he speaks when, when we really need him.

677
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:57,170
So.

678
00:37:57,752 --> 00:38:01,849
for example before we go into the pitch he always speaks and says

679
00:38:02,591 --> 00:38:06,241
the things that he thinks or...

680
00:38:07,845 --> 00:38:09,328
or that he wants.

681
00:38:10,129 --> 00:38:11,973
And that's really special for us.

682
00:38:12,955 --> 00:38:15,278
But as I said, his leadership is amazing.

683
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,965
It's not just by word, but it's more by example.

684
00:38:20,606 --> 00:38:21,888
Didn't start well either, did it?

685
00:38:22,589 --> 00:38:23,391
Saudi Arabia.

686
00:38:24,092 --> 00:38:24,553
No, it didn't start well.

687
00:38:24,573 --> 00:38:26,076
That must have been a bit of a shock.

688
00:38:26,416 --> 00:38:27,198
Yeah, it was.

689
00:38:27,478 --> 00:38:27,739
It was.

690
00:38:32,068 --> 00:38:33,752
But we always believed in ourselves.

691
00:38:34,514 --> 00:38:38,484
To be fair, we had like five or ten minutes after the game where

692
00:38:39,107 --> 00:38:39,536
Everyone.

693
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,662
was really sad and no one could speak.

694
00:38:43,582 --> 00:38:46,905
But after five or 10 minutes, our leaders

695
00:38:47,386 --> 00:38:53,119
Leo, Otamendi, these kind of players, spoke and said the truth like,

696
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,509
It was up to us, still up to us.

697
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:56,916
It wasn't easy.

698
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:00,251
But then at the end, we got the win against Mexico.

699
00:39:02,399 --> 00:39:05,087
From that on, everything was much easier.

700
00:39:05,388 --> 00:39:08,239
That was that moment with obviously Di Maria in too.

701
00:39:09,102 --> 00:39:11,152
to Messi and it was a special moment, wasn't it?

702
00:39:11,172 --> 00:39:12,217
It was like,

703
00:39:13,388 --> 00:39:15,014
Argentina's World Cup had started.

704
00:39:15,356 --> 00:39:15,556
Yeah.

705
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:16,399
Yeah.

706
00:39:17,543 --> 00:39:19,710
I think that game, the first half, you could feel

707
00:39:21,215 --> 00:39:25,043
the nervousness from the fans or even for us, it wasn't easy.

708
00:39:26,988 --> 00:39:29,814
We were nervous in the studio and I was watching that game.

709
00:39:29,894 --> 00:39:30,275
We were there.

710
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:38,435
And obviously, like most of the world, I wanted Argentina to win it for Messi if it couldn't be England.

711
00:39:38,575 --> 00:39:42,066
of course, obviously, which sadly it wasn't either.

712
00:39:42,688 --> 00:39:44,233
But let me take you forward to the final.

713
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:47,983
Because describe what happened on that day.

714
00:39:48,024 --> 00:39:49,187
What's it like on the day?

715
00:39:49,227 --> 00:39:50,009
Can you remember it?

716
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,101
Do you remember what you were like before the game?

717
00:39:52,122 --> 00:39:52,826
Were you nervous?

718
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:53,973
Excited?

719
00:39:54,474 --> 00:39:58,799
Yeah, during the workout something crazy because I normally get

720
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:03,844
really nervous before the games, but during the World Cup it didn't happen.

721
00:40:04,365 --> 00:40:04,947
I don't know why.

722
00:40:05,389 --> 00:40:05,870
I don't know why.

723
00:40:06,814 --> 00:40:08,098
Not even before the final.

724
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:15,064
and so basically when we when we are with the national team we have a lot of time off like

725
00:40:15,585 --> 00:40:16,787
we can do whatever we want

726
00:40:20,153 --> 00:40:24,449
And I remember that night I slept like 10 hours.

727
00:40:26,856 --> 00:40:29,380
I bet you didn't sleep 10 hours after the game.

728
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:33,088
No, no, for sure not.

729
00:40:33,208 --> 00:40:35,694
But yeah, 10 hours during the night.

730
00:40:35,854 --> 00:40:37,298
Then we had lunch.

731
00:40:38,001 --> 00:40:41,898
siesta and siesta for two hours and a half and

732
00:40:44,562 --> 00:40:50,456
I couldn't believe that because, you know, you get nervous, work a final, biggest stage on...

733
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:57,733
and I had I don't know how but I slept two two hours and a half before that and

734
00:40:58,796 --> 00:41:02,369
I went into a game, I think it was because I really trusted my...

735
00:41:02,911 --> 00:41:05,787
my team and my teammates to do well.

736
00:41:07,807 --> 00:41:10,274
And it was an amazing final for neutrals.

737
00:41:10,455 --> 00:41:11,919
And you played a significant part.

738
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:14,330
Yeah, I think everyone plays a part.

739
00:41:15,656 --> 00:41:16,922
But that goal in particular there?

740
00:41:18,168 --> 00:41:20,280
what a move what a beautiful bit of football that was

741
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,182
It was nice.

742
00:41:21,262 --> 00:41:24,353
I think it was the best goal of the World Cup.

743
00:41:26,761 --> 00:41:28,906
because of the way I think everyone play one touch.

744
00:41:29,607 --> 00:41:30,830
Amazing counter attack.

745
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,437
And after Di Maria, of course, an amazing goal.

746
00:41:37,687 --> 00:41:38,371
I felt really good.

747
00:41:38,492 --> 00:41:40,021
I felt really good when people asked me

748
00:41:40,402 --> 00:41:42,344
was the best game I've ever played.

749
00:41:42,364 --> 00:41:44,227
I always say the final because I felt

750
00:41:45,788 --> 00:41:49,231
really good and I felt important for the team.

751
00:41:49,271 --> 00:41:50,453
You said you felt really good.

752
00:41:51,013 --> 00:41:52,977
You're playing in a game, you're dominating it.

753
00:41:53,257 --> 00:41:54,279
France can't get a kick.

754
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,482
They're just not in it.

755
00:41:56,323 --> 00:41:59,355
And then suddenly, from two and a lot, you're two-two.

756
00:41:59,656 --> 00:41:59,897
I mean...

757
00:42:01,082 --> 00:42:02,207
You couldn't have felt that good then.

758
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:04,961
That must have been like, what on earth is happening here?

759
00:42:05,263 --> 00:42:07,395
For sure, it wasn't easy.

760
00:42:11,502 --> 00:42:12,246
when they score the 2-1,

761
00:42:15,641 --> 00:42:16,042
I don't know.

762
00:42:16,062 --> 00:42:18,265
I was still confident in ourself.

763
00:42:20,028 --> 00:42:21,310
But then after this,

764
00:42:21,631 --> 00:42:23,082
the equalizer

765
00:42:24,181 --> 00:42:25,082
It was so hard.

766
00:42:25,262 --> 00:42:25,783
It was so hard.

767
00:42:25,803 --> 00:42:29,027
I think everyone got nervous at that time.

768
00:42:29,227 --> 00:42:29,888
It wasn't easy.

769
00:42:29,948 --> 00:42:30,268
But then...

770
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:36,285
Again, like against Holland, we went to extra time, we showed again.

771
00:42:36,946 --> 00:42:39,149
And then it happened again.

772
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:40,431
And then it happened again.

773
00:42:41,673 --> 00:42:44,841
So it was a crazy game, I think, for neutrals, as you say.

774
00:42:45,122 --> 00:42:48,330
It was the most extraordinary match, I think the most memorable in my lifetime.

775
00:42:48,811 --> 00:42:53,763
I probably played in the second most memorable match of all time, which was Mexico 86, the quarter final.

776
00:42:54,405 --> 00:43:00,003
because of Diego's two goals, one with the hand and obviously one was the best goal probably ever scored.

777
00:43:00,845 --> 00:43:06,094
But to live that, to be part of the team, to go through that emotional roller coaster,

778
00:43:06,495 --> 00:43:09,042
And then the penalty shootout.

779
00:43:09,644 --> 00:43:11,911
I always thought you'd win a penalty shootout because of your goalkeeper.

780
00:43:12,332 --> 00:43:13,858
Because I'm not doing any work out here.

781
00:43:15,531 --> 00:43:17,277
I think he's one of the best today.

782
00:43:17,498 --> 00:43:18,180
Absolutely.

783
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,525
Did you see the save he made today?

784
00:43:19,726 --> 00:43:21,875
a week or so ago against Juventus yeah

785
00:43:23,904 --> 00:43:24,667
He was amazing.

786
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:26,715
I think he's one of the best.

787
00:43:26,956 --> 00:43:28,522
He strikes me as quite a personality.

788
00:43:29,184 --> 00:43:30,569
People doesn't like him.

789
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:31,974
He's the master of shithole.

790
00:43:34,521 --> 00:43:36,889
But I think you need one of these guys.

791
00:43:39,198 --> 00:43:42,315
in your team you need to win it's one of them that

792
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:45,124
When they are in the other team, you hate him.

793
00:43:45,304 --> 00:43:47,851
But when you have him in your team, then he's...

794
00:43:48,894 --> 00:43:53,484
He's one of the best, so really happy for him because he worked really hard.

795
00:43:54,065 --> 00:43:58,932
he struggled a little bit to play football, then he had the possibility to play for Arsenal.

796
00:44:00,235 --> 00:44:03,727
and since that moment he showed what he's capable of so

797
00:44:05,131 --> 00:44:07,136
really happy for him because he's a nice guy as well.

798
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,799
How was the penalty shootout?

799
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:19,936
to be fair it couldn't have gone better yeah to be fair I suffer more the penalty shooter against Holland and

800
00:44:20,738 --> 00:44:26,397
this one because yeah I think they missed the second and the third yeah

801
00:44:26,758 --> 00:44:32,789
So yeah, you could feel that we were going to become champions.

802
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:34,556
It wasn't that bad.

803
00:44:35,018 --> 00:44:37,390
Final whistle goes, the end of the penalty shootout.

804
00:44:38,394 --> 00:44:39,455
The penalty is scored.

805
00:44:40,676 --> 00:44:41,818
Can you remember how you felt?

806
00:44:41,938 --> 00:44:43,019
Do you remember the emotion?

807
00:44:43,219 --> 00:44:43,819
I was in shock.

808
00:44:44,741 --> 00:44:45,403
I was in shock.

809
00:44:45,603 --> 00:44:46,566
I didn't know what to do.

810
00:44:47,027 --> 00:44:49,073
I remember the first thing I did, it was...

811
00:44:49,815 --> 00:44:53,763
to look at behind the bench because my family was there.

812
00:44:54,184 --> 00:44:55,228
That must have been beautiful.

813
00:44:55,328 --> 00:44:56,412
That was so special.

814
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:57,536
That was so special.

815
00:44:57,576 --> 00:44:59,603
My family and some friends.

816
00:45:00,185 --> 00:45:03,271
that they they they left everything to go and

817
00:45:03,832 --> 00:45:07,356
there for the final i thought he's gonna say they left with five minutes to go no no no

818
00:45:08,898 --> 00:45:12,346
imagine that I don't think you could from that game so

819
00:45:12,907 --> 00:45:19,383
So yeah, it was so special to have them in the stands and to watch that game.

820
00:45:20,586 --> 00:45:24,980
yeah just looked looked at them and walk and

821
00:45:25,922 --> 00:45:27,365
Say thank you to the referees.

822
00:45:27,586 --> 00:45:28,167
I don't know why.

823
00:45:28,187 --> 00:45:29,289
I don't know.

824
00:45:29,991 --> 00:45:33,659
I was just in joke I didn't know what to do to be fair

825
00:45:37,007 --> 00:45:42,580
it didn't feel real real yeah so so yeah so so special

826
00:45:43,121 --> 00:45:44,904
Scaloni, what was he like?

827
00:45:45,546 --> 00:45:48,811
I mean, he did an amazing job, clearly, and he's hardly lost a game

828
00:45:50,034 --> 00:45:52,240
in all the time that he was there yeah

829
00:45:54,205 --> 00:45:57,531
He's an amazing human being and everything is easier when it's like this.

830
00:46:00,407 --> 00:46:06,650
He got the team in a really difficult moment for the country and for the national team.

831
00:46:07,952 --> 00:46:08,553
after Russia.

832
00:46:11,957 --> 00:46:15,680
And since that moment I think he understood what Messi needed.

833
00:46:17,381 --> 00:46:17,942
What did he need?

834
00:46:18,422 --> 00:46:23,454
He needed a good defense and people who

835
00:46:24,141 --> 00:46:27,390
could run and do the dirty job for him and then

836
00:46:28,666 --> 00:46:32,145
Just pass the ball to him and play for him, basically.

837
00:46:33,632 --> 00:46:35,522
but it's not easy because at the end

838
00:46:36,124 --> 00:46:40,148
I think everyone, every manager that it was before Scaloni tried that as well.

839
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:44,018
But it's hard winning major tournaments.

840
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:44,661
Yeah.

841
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:45,083
It's hard.

842
00:46:45,524 --> 00:46:46,385
It's so hard.

843
00:46:46,405 --> 00:46:51,069
What's it like playing on the same team as Lionel Messi?

844
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:57,195
At the beginning, it wasn't easy because, you know, you get nervous,

845
00:46:57,315 --> 00:47:01,136
You get a bit self-conscious because I know me with my first touch, I'd have been going, oh.

846
00:47:01,297 --> 00:47:02,462
God, this is so embarrassing.

847
00:47:02,522 --> 00:47:03,627
I mean, he's so good.

848
00:47:03,868 --> 00:47:05,414
Was there a degree of that?

849
00:47:05,555 --> 00:47:06,156
Sure, for sure.

850
00:47:06,176 --> 00:47:07,338
That was the first

851
00:47:10,823 --> 00:47:13,565
face, let's say, and I wasn't

852
00:47:14,326 --> 00:47:15,449
It wasn't easy.

853
00:47:16,131 --> 00:47:20,100
But then when you meet the guy and you speak with him, then...

854
00:47:20,802 --> 00:47:25,899
you realize that he's just a human being, that he's an amazing guy and

855
00:47:28,327 --> 00:47:33,144
You just need to understand him on the pitch and everything is easier.

856
00:47:34,569 --> 00:47:37,416
I have a really good connection with him on the pitch.

857
00:47:38,098 --> 00:47:42,951
And I think that's really, really important because I play

858
00:47:43,832 --> 00:47:47,377
and I move when I see what he does.

859
00:47:48,378 --> 00:47:50,403
So I react to his movement.

860
00:47:51,666 --> 00:47:53,450
Even before he's got the ball or when he's got the ball?

861
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:54,502
No, even before.

862
00:47:55,425 --> 00:47:58,934
I tried to be in different spaces, not to...

863
00:48:00,017 --> 00:48:04,883
into his space or because at the end he's always had like

864
00:48:05,444 --> 00:48:06,668
two or three guys on him.

865
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:07,812
So...

866
00:48:09,097 --> 00:48:13,152
There is a part of the pitch that is free if there is two or three with him.

867
00:48:13,934 --> 00:48:18,206
So I think it's about understanding those kind of things and that

868
00:48:19,871 --> 00:48:23,889
Give the ball to him and he will do what he wants and what he knows.

869
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:30,211
And sometimes, and even during that World Cup, many occasions, you must look at him and go, wow, how does he do that?

870
00:48:31,374 --> 00:48:36,942
even even training I woke up was score fantastic, but even in training if you

871
00:48:37,728 --> 00:48:40,298
You can give him whatever pass you want.

872
00:48:40,479 --> 00:48:42,146
His first touch will be amazing.

873
00:48:43,188 --> 00:48:43,870
That's the start.

874
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:47,603
And then, as I said, you make a movement and he will see it.

875
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:51,643
The pass he gave to Molina against Netherlands.

876
00:48:53,444 --> 00:48:54,385
How did you suggest him?

877
00:48:54,826 --> 00:48:55,907
Do you know what I was thinking?

878
00:48:55,947 --> 00:48:59,111
I don't know, sorry to interrupt, but when I watch Mercy,

879
00:49:00,919 --> 00:49:02,923
He sees things that you can't see from the stand.

880
00:49:03,424 --> 00:49:04,967
And it's almost like he's playing the game.

881
00:49:05,808 --> 00:49:10,037
as an out of body experience where he's looking at himself from above and has a whole view of the field.

882
00:49:11,089 --> 00:49:12,272
I mean, how does he see those?

883
00:49:12,393 --> 00:49:13,014
Do you ever go to him?

884
00:49:13,997 --> 00:49:14,679
How do you see that pass?

885
00:49:16,144 --> 00:49:19,081
no not really because that's what people forget sometimes isn't it we we

886
00:49:19,745 --> 00:49:21,029
We're obsessed with stats now.

887
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:23,178
It's goals and assists, but it's not that, is it?

888
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:23,860
It's not that.

889
00:49:24,944 --> 00:49:30,116
It's the little things he does on the halfway line when there's four players around him and you go, oh, he's done.

890
00:49:30,436 --> 00:49:32,321
And then he finds his way out.

891
00:49:33,002 --> 00:49:37,192
I think footballers look perhaps for more of that than perhaps fans do.

892
00:49:37,913 --> 00:49:39,896
I don't know what do you think I think he's got a

893
00:49:41,232 --> 00:49:44,321
a god apart, like he can do whatever he wants.

894
00:49:46,065 --> 00:49:48,249
everything looks easy for him

895
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:56,434
The difficult part is to understand that you are not at the same level as him because that's the truth.

896
00:49:57,176 --> 00:50:01,745
If you understand that and you play for him, then everything is easier.

897
00:50:02,847 --> 00:50:04,008
I really enjoy playing with him.

898
00:50:05,851 --> 00:50:07,593
That's the only thing I can say.

899
00:50:08,954 --> 00:50:13,770
I'm really lucky and really lucky and everyone on the national team is really lucky to play with him because

900
00:50:14,354 --> 00:50:15,925
There won't be anyone like him.

901
00:50:16,227 --> 00:50:17,334
No, I agree.

902
00:50:18,379 --> 00:50:22,811
When you won the World Cup, were you more pleased with Messi than yourself?

903
00:50:23,152 --> 00:50:23,293
No.

904
00:50:23,694 --> 00:50:23,914
Good.

905
00:50:24,095 --> 00:50:24,676
Sorry, but no.

906
00:50:24,696 --> 00:50:25,418
No, it's the right answer.

907
00:50:25,458 --> 00:50:25,919
Sorry, but no.

908
00:50:25,979 --> 00:50:26,982
No, it's the right answer.

909
00:50:27,002 --> 00:50:29,949
I thought I'd ask the question because the reaction of the team towards him.

910
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:32,033
I mean, everyone was pleased.

911
00:50:32,233 --> 00:50:35,980
I think the easy answer would be yes, but...

912
00:50:37,955 --> 00:50:41,179
Like, it is what I dreamed since I was a kid.

913
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:42,260
I want a World Cup.

914
00:50:43,122 --> 00:50:46,429
we want to work on and it felt amazing.

915
00:50:46,469 --> 00:50:49,275
But first, because of me, because of the

916
00:50:49,917 --> 00:50:56,075
the work that I've done for so many years because of the work that my family has done for me.

917
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,744
But yeah, of course that I was happy for him as well.

918
00:51:02,093 --> 00:51:02,876
What a way to finish.

919
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:04,683
We won a World Cup.

920
00:51:05,988 --> 00:51:06,570
I envy you.

921
00:51:06,991 --> 00:51:07,513
I envy you.

922
00:51:07,593 --> 00:51:10,340
And I also want to say a big thank you for this interview.

923
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:12,025
It's been fascinating, Alexis.

924
00:51:12,065 --> 00:51:12,727
Thank you very much.

925
00:51:12,927 --> 00:51:13,891
I got a present for you.

926
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:16,923
As you know, in Argentina we drink

927
00:51:17,585 --> 00:51:18,007
Matches.

928
00:51:18,128 --> 00:51:19,172
A lot of matches.

929
00:51:19,232 --> 00:51:19,413
Yes.

930
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:23,144
So basically... Is this mate for me?

931
00:51:23,304 --> 00:51:27,131
No, but this is made with yerba mate, with herbs.

932
00:51:27,612 --> 00:51:28,836
So yeah, it's a present for you.

933
00:51:29,798 --> 00:51:31,081
I hope you like it.

934
00:51:31,242 --> 00:51:32,685
There you go, the man with the golden boot.

935
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,292
And a silver mic, what an honour.

936
00:51:35,553 --> 00:51:40,126
We're up against it here because I know you normally prefer bags of crisps to cans of drinks.

937
00:51:40,648 --> 00:51:42,295
They go well together, Alexis.

938
00:51:42,897 --> 00:51:45,387
I fancy our chances, though, so if you don't like hearth...

939
00:51:45,849 --> 00:51:48,880
I'll play Liverpool's next match in my underwear.

940
00:51:50,887 --> 00:51:57,343
never make promises like that thank you thank you thank you very much for for coming i hope you liked

941
00:51:57,803 --> 00:51:58,103
Half?

942
00:51:58,604 --> 00:51:58,984
I did.

943
00:51:59,524 --> 00:52:02,326
First half and second half.

944
00:52:02,347 --> 00:52:03,107
So thank you very much.

945
00:52:03,127 --> 00:52:03,647
That's a pleasure.
