1062
00:50:25,282 --> 00:50:31,104
mainly outfield, but with such an in-depth knowledge of the biomechanics or biomechanical movement

1063
00:50:31,745 --> 00:50:37,173
That he can help you a lot couldn't he probably helped you a lot with India within your physio and your rehab like and

1064
00:50:37,374 --> 00:50:40,523
If you've got that in-depth knowledge of biomechanics and how goalkeepers move, huge.

1065
00:50:41,164 --> 00:50:41,685
Right then, mate.

1066
00:50:41,725 --> 00:50:42,766
So you've made the save.

1067
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:43,607
Full-time whistle's gone.

1068
00:50:43,627 --> 00:50:44,748
Penalty shootout, okay?

1069
00:50:45,048 --> 00:50:47,651
This is... We were watching it, wasn't we?

1070
00:50:48,113 --> 00:50:50,809
And we knew what was gonna happen.

1071
00:50:50,889 --> 00:50:51,533
It was inevitable.

1072
00:50:51,834 --> 00:50:55,123
and this is no slight on Hugo Lloris, but

1073
00:50:55,664 --> 00:51:00,110
when you put Hugo Lloris in goal and then you put you in goal, the size difference is just phenomenal.

1074
00:51:01,152 --> 00:51:03,499
so sort of daunting and you just failed the goal.

1075
00:51:03,699 --> 00:51:04,702
I don't think it's size though, is it?

1076
00:51:05,725 --> 00:51:06,347
What do you think it is?

1077
00:51:06,809 --> 00:51:08,273
I think it's personality.

1078
00:51:08,615 --> 00:51:09,056
Aura.

1079
00:51:09,257 --> 00:51:09,497
Aura.

1080
00:51:09,798 --> 00:51:10,802
I think it's, again, it's,

1081
00:51:11,243 --> 00:51:13,354
It boils down to confidence to the point of arrogance.

1082
00:51:13,394 --> 00:51:15,465
You see the look on the face and the way you hold yourself.

1083
00:51:16,147 --> 00:51:17,509
Small goalies can strip well, yeah?

1084
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:21,633
Like you've got some small goalies that you think are big on the pitch when they're quite small.

1085
00:51:22,274 --> 00:51:24,219
And some goalies that are big and look small.

1086
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:28,211
The big ones that look small in the goal and come off the pitch and go, yeah, actually quite big.

1087
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:28,993
Yeah, it's true, yeah.

1088
00:51:29,153 --> 00:51:33,192
And it's like, it's what you bring in terms of your personality.

1089
00:51:33,212 --> 00:51:33,292
Yeah.

1090
00:51:33,693 --> 00:51:39,498
it's like the um we went to man united away and the ronaldo thing remember it yeah yeah

1091
00:51:39,999 --> 00:51:41,926
And who was it who missed the penalty?

1092
00:51:42,047 --> 00:51:42,348
Bruno.

1093
00:51:42,368 --> 00:51:42,870
Bruno.

1094
00:51:43,171 --> 00:51:44,356
And we spoke about it before, didn't we?

1095
00:51:44,376 --> 00:51:45,099
What, what, what?

1096
00:51:45,219 --> 00:51:50,311
What little details can you bring into your game that's going to make you this person?

1097
00:51:50,612 --> 00:51:51,755
And it has to be that.

1098
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,721
personality.

1099
00:51:54,183 --> 00:51:57,856
You've got to bring an aura, a personality, a real like.

1100
00:51:58,558 --> 00:51:59,401
I'm not going to get beat.

1101
00:51:59,461 --> 00:52:01,950
Whereas it's not down to size.

1102
00:52:02,331 --> 00:52:03,014
It's your presence.

1103
00:52:03,234 --> 00:52:05,019
We said that when we were watching the game.

1104
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,102
We actually said that

1105
00:52:06,805 --> 00:52:08,192
And he's making the goal look small.

1106
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:08,554
Yeah.

1107
00:52:08,755 --> 00:52:08,936
Yeah.

1108
00:52:08,956 --> 00:52:10,504
And like you were saying earlier on, cuts about...

1109
00:52:10,805 --> 00:52:13,232
how you conduct yourself, you know, shoulders back.

1110
00:52:13,312 --> 00:52:14,355
It's that aura, isn't it?

1111
00:52:14,415 --> 00:52:15,337
Making yourself big.

1112
00:52:15,598 --> 00:52:16,019
Bigger.

1113
00:52:16,139 --> 00:52:18,702
You know, he'd look in his eyes and go, he's saving it.

1114
00:52:19,062 --> 00:52:19,282
Yeah.

1115
00:52:19,343 --> 00:52:20,083
It's not because he's big.

1116
00:52:20,404 --> 00:52:20,544
Yeah.

1117
00:52:20,564 --> 00:52:21,025
It's just like...

1118
00:52:21,665 --> 00:52:22,206
Yeah.

1119
00:52:22,486 --> 00:52:24,789
Even I suppose it's a lanky after getting to you.

1120
00:52:24,929 --> 00:52:25,831
Why do you put it so high?

1121
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,112
I've never seen you put in that high.

1122
00:52:27,152 --> 00:52:27,513
So may

1123
00:52:27,993 --> 00:52:31,419
i don't know where to go you you made it i have to go really yeah

1124
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:34,927
I actually asked Solanki, I said, it's a great pen, but why do you go so high?

1125
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:38,702
We watch penalties, so you never go that high.

1126
00:52:39,425 --> 00:52:41,308
I said, mate, I have to change something.

1127
00:52:41,389 --> 00:52:42,190
I have to go there.

1128
00:52:42,631 --> 00:52:44,194
Because he knows you'll save it otherwise.

1129
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:45,156
Yeah, that's fascinating.

1130
00:52:45,677 --> 00:52:47,461
You know, you can get there to the side.

1131
00:52:47,681 --> 00:52:50,287
I know you can get to the side, so I have to put a right in the corner.

1132
00:52:50,387 --> 00:52:54,933
This is what this, that, that I will only back myself up a little bit and say, when I say about size, right?

1133
00:52:55,054 --> 00:52:55,835
Some of the penalties,

1134
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:57,740
you are nearly touching the post.

1135
00:52:58,282 --> 00:53:00,770
By the time you finish a sable, when you get your hand on the ball,

1136
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:02,134
you're nearly on the post.

1137
00:53:02,294 --> 00:53:03,097
That's not size, is it?

1138
00:53:03,377 --> 00:53:04,280
It's got to be size.

1139
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:04,621
No.

1140
00:53:04,822 --> 00:53:05,283
What is it?

1141
00:53:05,444 --> 00:53:05,544
It's...

1142
00:53:06,025 --> 00:53:12,253
speed power push and power you don't have to yeah i think i believe that is power and timing yeah

1143
00:53:12,834 --> 00:53:13,255
Timing.

1144
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,623
I'm all over this.

1145
00:53:16,723 --> 00:53:19,570
I'm not saying, I always say if you get the timing right,

1146
00:53:20,713 --> 00:53:23,840
I'll reach a post just the timing if you're going to save a penalty you don't

1147
00:53:24,221 --> 00:53:25,285
go to the ball, dear.

1148
00:53:25,305 --> 00:53:26,468
To be fair, anyone can save a penalty.

1149
00:53:26,489 --> 00:53:29,960
Go through the ball, go past the ball, his speed and his power, how quick he can go from here to there.

1150
00:53:30,622 --> 00:53:30,802
Right?

1151
00:53:31,023 --> 00:53:32,065
And it has to be like, boom.

1152
00:53:32,406 --> 00:53:33,649
So it's timing and speed and power.

1153
00:53:34,371 --> 00:53:36,997
Speed equals distance divided by... How quickly you can transfer your body weight, isn't it?

1154
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:39,728
how quickly you can get onto your leading leg.

1155
00:53:39,748 --> 00:53:40,672
I've got to ask you, Emi,

1156
00:53:41,273 --> 00:53:46,180
Some of the viewers might think this is a strange question, but we've had professor Steve Peters on psychologists on

1157
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,165
And they talk about the gold medal syndrome.

1158
00:53:48,205 --> 00:53:50,852
Now, World Cup's the biggest prize you can win.

1159
00:53:50,953 --> 00:53:52,517
Did you have a moment where you had that...

1160
00:53:53,058 --> 00:53:56,965
gold medal syndrome where you almost had a low after or not.

1161
00:53:57,687 --> 00:53:57,948
No.

1162
00:53:58,269 --> 00:53:59,112
Not just high.

1163
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:00,016
Always high, yeah.

1164
00:54:00,638 --> 00:54:00,859
But...

1165
00:54:02,244 --> 00:54:06,169
After the shoot, after the World Cup, when I was home, I said,

1166
00:54:06,931 --> 00:54:11,740
i reached my dream i can't go any higher because the feeling i had after that work up is like

1167
00:54:12,361 --> 00:54:15,946
Even if I win the next one, I already know what I felt.

1168
00:54:16,767 --> 00:54:18,109
So now what's next?

1169
00:54:18,509 --> 00:54:20,832
When you win the Golden Glove in the Copa America,

1170
00:54:21,352 --> 00:54:23,915
You win the Super Cup, you win the Golden Glove and the World Cup.

1171
00:54:24,476 --> 00:54:25,697
It's like, what else can I win?

1172
00:54:26,419 --> 00:54:30,747
Like, if you win the best on Yashin, which I won, it's just individual, you know.

1173
00:54:31,588 --> 00:54:34,615
I wanted the World Cup since I was five years old.

1174
00:54:35,056 --> 00:54:36,800
My boy is obsessed with the World Cup.

1175
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:37,923
That's why I wanted to win.

1176
00:54:38,925 --> 00:54:42,093
But now that's when the psychology comes.

1177
00:54:43,416 --> 00:54:43,978
What's next?

1178
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:47,549
How can I be motivated when I already reached my dreams?

1179
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,555
It kind of answers my question.

1180
00:54:49,595 --> 00:54:52,563
Like I said, maybe I positioned it incorrectly and low, but...

1181
00:54:52,944 --> 00:54:54,267
I always find a way.

1182
00:54:54,728 --> 00:54:58,214
I want to get Aston Villa in the Champions League.

1183
00:54:58,917 --> 00:54:59,881
I was upset with it.

1184
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:02,273
I was like, I need to get this club because he...

1185
00:55:02,734 --> 00:55:08,448
I won the World Cup after 38 years in Argentina, won the Copa America after 30 years,

1186
00:55:09,149 --> 00:55:11,132
We never beat Brazil in the Maracanã.

1187
00:55:12,153 --> 00:55:15,517
The first game that they lost in qualifiers in history was against us.

1188
00:55:15,657 --> 00:55:18,971
in December, so I always find leader target like

1189
00:55:19,353 --> 00:55:25,031
huge target because let's say you play for Man United you qualify you make top four it's

1190
00:55:25,933 --> 00:55:27,718
You know, it's a big season.

1191
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:32,269
Even if he's starting on with Chelsea, it's more or less anyone can do it or, you know, it's a big club.

1192
00:55:32,972 --> 00:55:35,046
Aston Villa 42 years I said what if

1193
00:55:36,172 --> 00:55:36,634
I can do it.

1194
00:55:37,015 --> 00:55:38,539
What if we're done?

1195
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:39,442
It's something like...

1196
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:43,568
it's hard to do special it's it's that's me it's challenging myself

1197
00:55:44,069 --> 00:55:46,756
That's the equivalent of Man City winning the league, isn't it?

1198
00:55:46,837 --> 00:55:48,181
Really, let's be honest.

1199
00:55:48,321 --> 00:55:49,785
Villa getting in the Champions League is...

1200
00:55:50,327 --> 00:55:50,607
It's huge.

1201
00:55:50,627 --> 00:55:52,231
It's absolutely monumental.

1202
00:55:52,371 --> 00:55:55,178
And for me, and I say that to my mum, I say that to my agents,

1203
00:55:56,922 --> 00:55:59,668
It means more staying in a club like Villa

1204
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:02,800
and deliver what I was dreaming.

1205
00:56:03,142 --> 00:56:04,848
It's like winning a title with Argentina.

1206
00:56:05,491 --> 00:56:06,033
So what next?

1207
00:56:06,054 --> 00:56:08,725
You've got to win the Champions League then because you've ticked everything else off, haven't you?

1208
00:56:08,745 --> 00:56:10,191
Well, it's a title next week.

1209
00:56:10,975 --> 00:56:11,537
I like that.

1210
00:56:11,638 --> 00:56:13,325
Yeah, that's that's next.

1211
00:56:13,365 --> 00:56:13,626
All right.

1212
00:56:13,646 --> 00:56:14,309
Can I take you back to the

1213
00:56:14,349 --> 00:56:15,192
penalties then, okay?

1214
00:56:15,212 --> 00:56:18,241
So this is where the programme notes start to come into their own, Emi, all right?

1215
00:56:18,682 --> 00:56:22,309
Was you aware, by the way, before the penalty shootout started that you were going to kind of

1216
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:24,717
Just do a little bit of theatrics.

1217
00:56:24,758 --> 00:56:27,188
Just try and get in the head of the French players a little bit.

1218
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:34,220
Yeah, obviously I spoke with the psychologist about it because when you're controlling the game,

1219
00:56:35,445 --> 00:56:38,140
you concede three goals is like well at

1220
00:56:38,321 --> 00:56:39,848
I didn't really have a good game there.

1221
00:56:39,928 --> 00:56:41,877
Three goals conceded in five shots.

1222
00:56:43,204 --> 00:56:45,895
made a good save at the end, but that was it really.

1223
00:56:46,658 --> 00:56:51,122
When I go into a shootout, it's like I bring my boy into the playground.

1224
00:56:52,003 --> 00:56:54,087
You know, he's crying in the car.

1225
00:56:54,128 --> 00:56:54,969
Oh, Santi playground.

1226
00:56:55,911 --> 00:56:58,543
And actually, I feel like I dominate that area.

1227
00:56:59,507 --> 00:57:02,661
I can lose, win, or I can save one or not.

1228
00:57:03,645 --> 00:57:07,182
If you watch me, I went straight into the goal.

1229
00:57:08,044 --> 00:57:13,214
Even I had a shootout as well the other day and I went into the goal like, this is my zone, I need to control it, you know.

1230
00:57:14,096 --> 00:57:16,766
And then obviously I like to watch goalie.

1231
00:57:16,786 --> 00:57:17,790
I watch a lot of football.

1232
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:18,934
I watch football every day.

1233
00:57:19,637 --> 00:57:22,509
And then I seen Lloris so many years in the Premier League.

1234
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:23,072
I know how...

1235
00:57:23,634 --> 00:57:25,201
what he brings to the table.

1236
00:57:25,222 --> 00:57:26,427
He's a really good goalie, but

1237
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,840
In that time, it's like it's me against him.

1238
00:57:29,001 --> 00:57:30,228
It's not me against Mpappe.

1239
00:57:31,172 --> 00:57:33,239
You know, people say, no, you in the head.

1240
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,422
I'm in my head.

1241
00:57:35,124 --> 00:57:36,167
It's me against Lloris.

1242
00:57:37,271 --> 00:57:41,829
Is Messi against Mbappe or is, I don't know, Otamendi against Konati?

1243
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:43,391
It's me against Lloris.

1244
00:57:43,511 --> 00:57:45,413
And I knew that fact at that moment.

1245
00:57:45,593 --> 00:57:47,555
Maybe he got more experience than me.

1246
00:57:47,695 --> 00:57:48,676
Maybe he played more games.

1247
00:57:49,579 --> 00:57:52,091
But I fall in that moment, I'm way better than you.

1248
00:57:53,719 --> 00:57:55,705
She's in that different game, which is shootout.

1249
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:57,672
So that's when I come.

1250
00:57:57,852 --> 00:57:58,755
If I beat Lloris...

1251
00:57:59,157 --> 00:58:01,709
I got a big chance to win the World Cup.

1252
00:58:01,971 --> 00:58:02,473
It's like...

1253
00:58:03,697 --> 00:58:06,700
when it goes to penalties, it's almost like, right, it's Emi's time now.

1254
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:07,241
It's a different game.

1255
00:58:07,301 --> 00:58:08,262
It's my house now.

1256
00:58:08,502 --> 00:58:09,426
This is it.

1257
00:58:09,446 --> 00:58:10,731
And that's how it goes down, isn't it?

1258
00:58:10,771 --> 00:58:11,253
Yeah, it is.

1259
00:58:12,076 --> 00:58:13,180
All right then, the first penalty.

1260
00:58:15,087 --> 00:58:15,929
Mbappe.

1261
00:58:17,733 --> 00:58:18,956
Top hand, nearly.

1262
00:58:19,578 --> 00:58:19,979
Nearly.

1263
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:21,865
Were you disappointed with the first penalty?

1264
00:58:22,441 --> 00:58:24,630
Yeah, can we talk about timing in the goalkeeping?

1265
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:26,838
Timing, get it at night, obviously...

1266
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:32,204
Messi spoke about it and he does two, three steps and goes straight into the ball.

1267
00:58:32,224 --> 00:58:32,664
So I was...

1268
00:58:33,706 --> 00:58:35,369
By the time he's shooting, I'm still skipping.

1269
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:38,175
Maybe she's gone a little bit earlier.

1270
00:58:38,596 --> 00:58:41,880
And then because I concede already too, I knew he was going right.

1271
00:58:42,361 --> 00:58:44,384
I knew, I definitely knew he was going right.

1272
00:58:45,025 --> 00:58:47,551
But then I thought, why did I not go a little bit early?

1273
00:58:48,673 --> 00:58:51,560
And then I went low rather than high, mid-high.

1274
00:58:51,941 --> 00:58:54,246
And I knew that he likes mid-high.

1275
00:58:56,911 --> 00:58:59,814
Shit, you know, I got it wrong, got it all wrong.

1276
00:59:00,396 --> 00:59:03,169
got it all wrong because for me that's a comfortable safe.

1277
00:59:03,209 --> 00:59:04,394
So, but at the end,

1278
00:59:05,318 --> 00:59:07,023
I didn't think, oh, it's not my day.

1279
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:07,906
I can't say one.

1280
00:59:07,966 --> 00:59:09,631
I just went, if I say two...

1281
00:59:11,076 --> 00:59:12,944
It's coming, it's coming.

1282
00:59:13,024 --> 00:59:13,868
One's going to come in a minute.

1283
00:59:14,269 --> 00:59:17,795
When you were watching this Cuts on Holiday, you were at this point just a bag of nerves.

1284
00:59:19,538 --> 00:59:20,740
You probably should have said that.

1285
00:59:21,761 --> 00:59:22,442
He would have said that.

1286
00:59:22,482 --> 00:59:24,325
That's why I said it, because I know that's what he would have said.

1287
00:59:25,067 --> 00:59:29,084
Yeah, it's difficult because you're so far away and all you want to do is for him to win.

1288
00:59:29,104 --> 00:59:29,847
It's like...

1289
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:32,920
You can't scream at the telly and say, you should have saved that, all right?

1290
00:59:33,121 --> 00:59:33,844
What are you doing?

1291
00:59:34,205 --> 00:59:34,526
Yeah.

1292
00:59:34,787 --> 00:59:35,350
No, not quite.

1293
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:38,100
I'm just like desperate for him to win.

1294
00:59:39,747 --> 00:59:42,438
Okay, so then Messi takes the next penalty.

1295
00:59:43,523 --> 00:59:45,274
Excuse my language, it's a piss take of a penalty.

1296
00:59:45,294 --> 00:59:46,784
It is a piss take of a penalty, right?

1297
00:59:47,586 --> 00:59:52,092
I talk about then how Lloris do, you know, how he behaves.

1298
00:59:52,152 --> 00:59:53,654
I said, if you stop, you're going to score.

1299
00:59:53,854 --> 00:59:59,567
Because I remember Jorginho against him in the Premier League.

1300
00:59:59,868 --> 01:00:02,415
I think Vardy stopped as well against him.

1301
01:00:02,435 --> 01:00:03,357
He went way too early.

1302
01:00:03,397 --> 01:00:05,122
So I said, Leo, just stop and go.

1303
01:00:06,065 --> 01:00:06,626
He will move.

1304
01:00:06,867 --> 01:00:08,612
He moves to his left.

1305
01:00:08,873 --> 01:00:11,460
He rolls it not far off the centre of it.

1306
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:12,323
In a World Cup final.

1307
01:00:12,925 --> 01:00:14,109
He won't stay in the middle.

1308
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:15,836
Lloris will never stay in the middle.

1309
01:00:16,358 --> 01:00:20,376
So it's kind of like when I talk to my teammates in the national team, they listen as well.

1310
01:00:21,441 --> 01:00:24,414
i said go to the middle go in the middle go one at least one in the middle

1311
01:00:25,136 --> 01:00:28,687
So we scored two out of five because I was through the middle.

1312
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:32,805
And then Kingsley Coman steps up.

1313
01:00:33,709 --> 01:00:35,895
Big save, comfortable save.

1314
01:00:36,356 --> 01:00:39,563
When you dive in that way, and it almost hits you in the chest, doesn't it?

1315
01:00:39,584 --> 01:00:40,566
It does hit you in the chest, yeah.

1316
01:00:40,806 --> 01:00:46,592
I missed it are you you just know you're saving it though don't you because you've already you're so you almost drive past it don't you

1317
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:52,546
yeah but you know i i watched penalties the day before and i watched griezmann

1318
01:00:53,228 --> 01:00:58,480
jerut empape baran and afimwani

1319
01:00:59,582 --> 01:01:02,429
So then Griezmann wasn't on the pitch.

1320
01:01:02,449 --> 01:01:03,752
Giroud wasn't on the pitch.

1321
01:01:03,913 --> 01:01:06,038
Dembele wasn't on the pitch, I looked.

1322
01:01:07,062 --> 01:01:08,087
Baran wasn't on the pitch.

1323
01:01:08,730 --> 01:01:11,082
So for the in-comer, I said, I don't know where he's going.

1324
01:01:11,263 --> 01:01:16,641
So that's when it comes, you know, that intuition that I always believe that I back myself up.

1325
01:01:16,822 --> 01:01:17,825
So it's about timing.

1326
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:22,231
And that's when I got a really, really, I'll say I jumped more than I should have.

1327
01:01:22,952 --> 01:01:27,242
It's more just, you know, I was probably so nervous.

1328
01:01:27,664 --> 01:01:31,316
Not so nervous, but so tense that I missed the ball and it hit my chest.

1329
01:01:33,182 --> 01:01:37,797
And that feeling, the way I was jumping, if he goes, yeah, that's me, that's me, I got it right, you know.

1330
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:42,730
I didn't because I was so frustrated for before for not saving them puppies.

1331
01:01:43,874 --> 01:01:45,585
for that's more like me, you know?

1332
01:01:45,706 --> 01:01:45,908
Yeah.

1333
01:01:47,396 --> 01:01:48,457
That I find interesting.

1334
01:01:48,477 --> 01:01:51,420
You know where he says about that tense feeling, that nerve, it's not nerve feeling.

1335
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:52,941
It's like, it's so much energy.

1336
01:01:53,984 --> 01:01:59,240
isn't it it's so well it's hard to describe that you almost can't feel your fingers

1337
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:00,382
What, adrenaline?

1338
01:02:00,402 --> 01:02:00,863
Crazy.

1339
01:02:02,326 --> 01:02:05,271
Concentration or I don't know what that is, but it's just...

1340
01:02:06,915 --> 01:02:08,720
You know goalies having cramps.

1341
01:02:09,061 --> 01:02:10,244
How can a goalie have a cramp?

1342
01:02:10,524 --> 01:02:15,129
It's because you're so tense, you're so nervous that your muscle contracts, isn't it?

1343
01:02:15,149 --> 01:02:16,130
Yeah, that's right.

1344
01:02:18,199 --> 01:02:20,147
It was a comfortable save in the end.

1345
01:02:21,451 --> 01:02:23,816
I want to talk about the Cermény penalty though.

1346
01:02:23,916 --> 01:02:26,300
So third penalty for France, he drags it wide.

1347
01:02:27,265 --> 01:02:30,644
But this is where, and we're going to talk about shithousery in a minute if that's okay.

1348
01:02:31,567 --> 01:02:33,591
But this is where you came into your own a little bit.

1349
01:02:33,631 --> 01:02:34,453
I was buzzing off it.

1350
01:02:34,493 --> 01:02:36,377
I think it's a fair play if you can do it.

1351
01:02:36,999 --> 01:02:39,986
do it all day long you throw the ball away a little bit

1352
01:02:40,468 --> 01:02:44,221
And the bit that I really like about this and we talked about it a minute ago is

1353
01:02:44,763 --> 01:02:47,791
Um, the camera sort of pans to Tiumeni's face and he,

1354
01:02:48,072 --> 01:02:49,337
And he's trying to act all cool.

1355
01:02:49,457 --> 01:02:50,802
Like, I'm not fazed by this.

1356
01:02:50,822 --> 01:02:51,966
This ain't even a thing, all right?

1357
01:02:52,427 --> 01:02:53,170
And he has this little...

1358
01:02:53,833 --> 01:02:57,268
double nervous grin honestly it's so double nervous it's ridiculous right

1359
01:02:57,549 --> 01:02:59,932
And I'm thinking, oh, mate, I don't like the look of that.

1360
01:03:00,232 --> 01:03:02,915
Then the camera pans to Didier Deschamps on the sidelines.

1361
01:03:03,155 --> 01:03:07,343
and he's fuming it yeah he's like effing and jeffing and cussing and all that kind of stuff

1362
01:03:07,845 --> 01:03:09,532
And it comes back to Tumeni.

1363
01:03:09,793 --> 01:03:12,123
He steps up to take the penalty and it's inevitable.

1364
01:03:12,344 --> 01:03:12,625
Isn't it?

1365
01:03:12,745 --> 01:03:14,308
It is inevitable what he's going to do.

1366
01:03:14,348 --> 01:03:15,832
You know, I'll come to you because.

1367
01:03:16,112 --> 01:03:17,296
You know he's going to drag it, don't you?

1368
01:03:17,476 --> 01:03:18,880
Yeah, and it is one of them.

1369
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:19,482
You can see it.

1370
01:03:19,602 --> 01:03:20,465
You can see it on his face.

1371
01:03:20,485 --> 01:03:22,290
You're like, oh, he's not quite sure, this boy.

1372
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:25,963
And then that's when you know you've got one over straight away.

1373
01:03:26,043 --> 01:03:27,287
It's like, I've got him.

1374
01:03:27,548 --> 01:03:28,150
Like, I've got him.

1375
01:03:29,475 --> 01:03:34,050
But I knew it was the time because I'm never doing the first pen or the second one.

1376
01:03:34,751 --> 01:03:37,474
It's when I got a big chance that we can win it.

1377
01:03:37,574 --> 01:03:40,716
So I saved, I nearly got in pappers against the side.

1378
01:03:41,437 --> 01:03:42,319
I got a second one.

1379
01:03:42,739 --> 01:03:44,482
So I'm thinking when I

1380
01:03:45,807 --> 01:03:48,741
When I look at the young lad coming, it's like, if he missed that pen...

1381
01:03:50,906 --> 01:03:53,312
they might be losing this World Cup.

1382
01:03:53,432 --> 01:03:55,336
So I thought, that's when, what am I doing?

1383
01:03:56,138 --> 01:03:58,264
I said, he needs to go and get it further up.

1384
01:03:58,404 --> 01:03:59,708
You know, he needs it further up.

1385
01:03:59,748 --> 01:04:01,012
I need to do something, you know.

1386
01:04:01,152 --> 01:04:02,215
That's personality, isn't it?

1387
01:04:02,435 --> 01:04:04,479
And the ref was like... Pure personality and presence.

1388
01:04:04,539 --> 01:04:06,763
The ref didn't know what to do, you know, I felt like, no.

1389
01:04:06,963 --> 01:04:08,806
I just keep walking, you know, I just keep walking.

1390
01:04:08,826 --> 01:04:10,088
You threw it just the right.

1391
01:04:10,309 --> 01:04:10,889
Yeah, perfect.

1392
01:04:12,532 --> 01:04:14,820
Because it's hard, you know, when you walk.

1393
01:04:16,124 --> 01:04:21,492
yards to take the penalty, how many yards is, I don't know, but in a World Cup final.

1394
01:04:22,434 --> 01:04:26,449
You can practice 150 penalties in training and you can put in the top corner.

1395
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:27,413
Top bins are easy.

1396
01:04:27,854 --> 01:04:31,082
And then when you go into a World Cup final behind all Argentinian fans,

1397
01:04:31,564 --> 01:04:35,294
They were singing, which that means he will eat you up.

1398
01:04:37,222 --> 01:04:39,734
I'm saying he's going to be feeling something at all.

1399
01:04:40,016 --> 01:04:41,243
I know he played for Real Madrid.

1400
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:42,591
He'd be feeling something.

1401
01:04:42,852 --> 01:04:43,717
I can see it in his face.

1402
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:48,990
But then you need to have that luck that you save it or not because otherwise you look like a twat.

1403
01:04:49,030 --> 01:04:49,411
Yeah.

1404
01:04:51,256 --> 01:04:56,788
So, and then he, I knew it was going to cross his body shape.

1405
01:04:57,008 --> 01:04:57,429
Kicking glue.

1406
01:04:58,998 --> 01:05:00,688
You know, you've been a goalie, you can see more or less.

1407
01:05:01,754 --> 01:05:06,473
you can't really guess by his body shape he can't go he cannot be his foot he was like he's so close

1408
01:05:06,693 --> 01:05:13,370
off it's the only place he can go and I thought if he was going in I would definitely save it I feel like something

1409
01:05:14,078 --> 01:05:14,503
You know when you...

1410
01:05:17,398 --> 01:05:21,506
You know, when you don't touch it, but you feel like the air or something in your hands.

1411
01:05:21,846 --> 01:05:22,267
I touch it.

1412
01:05:22,889 --> 01:05:25,960
Yeah, that's why I started dancing because I thought, yeah, I got him.

1413
01:05:26,823 --> 01:05:28,149
So that's what I want to talk about.

1414
01:05:28,189 --> 01:05:29,877
I've got here the horrible shoulder dance.

1415
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:33,701
I swear my mum's like, I've never, ever done it.

1416
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:35,263
I can't even move my shoulders nowadays.

1417
01:05:35,343 --> 01:05:36,924
I don't know how I've done it.

1418
01:05:37,645 --> 01:05:39,651
I've never practiced it.

1419
01:05:40,453 --> 01:05:41,335
It's so good.

1420
01:05:41,676 --> 01:05:43,020
That just came up in that moment.

1421
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:44,524
Do you know how many kids are doing that now?

1422
01:05:44,644 --> 01:05:45,426
Oh, I know.

1423
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:49,235
A friend of ours, we're going to do a podcast with him, and he said,

1424
01:05:50,639 --> 01:05:51,784
our little lad at the weekend.

1425
01:05:51,804 --> 01:05:52,507
Doing the whole thing.

1426
01:05:53,772 --> 01:05:55,015
Horrible, it was so horrible.

1427
01:05:55,036 --> 01:05:59,105
We went to Dubai with my wife and my kids and said, and these young lads, you know, on the beach,

1428
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:03,379
Look what you've done.

1429
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:04,584
I said, what can I do?

1430
01:06:04,624 --> 01:06:05,126
You know what I mean?

1431
01:06:05,146 --> 01:06:05,307
Yeah.

1432
01:06:05,808 --> 01:06:12,283
Another thing I really liked as well then is when Paredes scored his penalty and you kind of sprinted to him, he sprinted to you.

1433
01:06:12,744 --> 01:06:15,757
And that unity of you two, it's like...

1434
01:06:16,018 --> 01:06:17,503
that was your 18-yard box.

1435
01:06:17,544 --> 01:06:18,065
You know what I mean?

1436
01:06:18,206 --> 01:06:21,297
It was like it was... That whole area was just Argentine.

1437
01:06:21,799 --> 01:06:21,919
And...

1438
01:06:22,502 --> 01:06:26,622
I think the French would have even seen that happening, that little celebration and gone,

1439
01:06:27,185 --> 01:06:27,849
we don't belong here.

1440
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:29,096
Like they sent ours.

1441
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:30,684
It was inevitable at that point, wasn't it?

1442
01:06:30,965 --> 01:06:34,831
it becomes a habit you know because they're so good at penalties you know because

1443
01:06:35,372 --> 01:06:39,000
Hugo Paredes, oh my God, he can strike Messi, Dybala.

1444
01:06:39,522 --> 01:06:43,350
You got Montiel, never miss a pin, outpaning his career.

1445
01:06:43,811 --> 01:06:44,412
McAllister.

1446
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:50,472
six he was a six taker he got so many takers i thought mate with the takers i got

1447
01:06:51,074 --> 01:06:51,597
Di Maria.

1448
01:06:51,617 --> 01:06:51,938
Yeah.

1449
01:07:11,507 --> 01:07:13,370
If I say one or two, that's it.

1450
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:14,832
And they know that I can save it.

1451
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:15,994
I've done it every time.

1452
01:07:16,034 --> 01:07:17,136
So I thought, you know, it's a...

1453
01:07:17,818 --> 01:07:22,097
That unity, like you said, once we got to penalties, we win.

1454
01:07:22,358 --> 01:07:23,482
You can win or lose.

1455
01:07:24,366 --> 01:07:25,791
It doesn't mean we're going to win every time.

1456
01:07:26,673 --> 01:07:28,757
I always say the big ones we already done it.

1457
01:07:29,077 --> 01:07:31,421
And when Gonzalo Montiel puts that penalty in,

1458
01:07:33,665 --> 01:07:36,406
The celebration is incredible, but what's it like for him now?

1459
01:07:36,447 --> 01:07:39,589
Because I can only kind of imagine in England, right, if...

1460
01:07:40,210 --> 01:07:40,952
I don't know who it is.

1461
01:07:41,192 --> 01:07:45,362
Somebody, John Stones runs up and scores that winning penalty for England, right?

1462
01:07:45,422 --> 01:07:46,766
He's just done that for Argentina.

1463
01:07:47,107 --> 01:07:48,273
What is he like at home?

1464
01:07:48,413 --> 01:07:49,539
Is he a hero?

1465
01:07:49,579 --> 01:07:49,619
Is...

1466
01:07:50,985 --> 01:07:54,751
Is the whole team a hero or is there something reserved specially for him?

1467
01:07:55,593 --> 01:07:59,910
You know when you're a young lad, you've got memories, isn't it?

1468
01:08:00,271 --> 01:08:04,122
So every child in Argentina, we remember Montiel.

1469
01:08:05,285 --> 01:08:11,481
like Agüero, you know, and that moment, you know, when you're young, you just, you've got memories, so...

1470
01:08:12,303 --> 01:08:18,117
I think whatever happens in Montiel's career, he will be well known back home forever, you know.

1471
01:08:18,297 --> 01:08:19,722
Forever, forever a legend.

1472
01:08:19,983 --> 01:08:21,708
I loved it when it finished because it was

1473
01:08:22,210 --> 01:08:25,299
No one will remember Paredes penalty in 10 years.

1474
01:08:25,399 --> 01:08:25,820
No chance.

1475
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:26,141
Montiel's.

1476
01:08:27,344 --> 01:08:33,772
Maybe Messi, Maizé and Montillo, even though he played 10 minutes in the World Cup, in the final.

1477
01:08:34,252 --> 01:08:40,331
really yeah there was two there was two focal points of the celebration wasn't there there was you and there was there was messy

1478
01:08:41,094 --> 01:08:44,967
And then half the team kind of split and it was just, it was absolute chaos, wasn't it?

1479
01:08:45,047 --> 01:08:45,910
There's no fans more

1480
01:08:45,970 --> 01:08:47,011
passionate than Argentina.

1481
01:08:47,051 --> 01:08:47,612
No, no.

1482
01:08:47,913 --> 01:08:49,134
They're like incredible, aren't they?

1483
01:08:49,154 --> 01:08:51,798
I always say to you, come to Argentina to watch me play.

1484
01:08:51,818 --> 01:08:52,298
It's just...

1485
01:08:52,839 --> 01:08:55,129
I went to Miami tonight just before you went to the World Cup.

1486
01:08:55,611 --> 01:08:55,732
Yeah.

1487
01:08:56,274 --> 01:08:57,896
before probably the last camp that you went to.

1488
01:08:57,936 --> 01:09:00,801
In Argentina they choose 60,000 pounds singing and

1489
01:09:00,981 --> 01:09:04,382
jumping and then you just go back placing your tummy and then

1490
01:09:04,885 --> 01:09:09,062
The adrenaline, you know, I never felt pressure before, ever.

1491
01:09:10,106 --> 01:09:13,800
Obviously, when you're young, yes, but when I was older, I never thought coming into a game

1492
01:09:14,542 --> 01:09:17,985
But when I went into the first game of the World Cup.

1493
01:09:18,025 --> 01:09:18,726
Saudi Arabia game.

1494
01:09:18,766 --> 01:09:19,527
Saudi Arabia game.

1495
01:09:19,988 --> 01:09:23,381
And I walk onto the pitch with all the fans screaming in that scenario.

1496
01:09:24,104 --> 01:09:27,189
I felt like a heat inside my body that I'd never felt before, ever.

1497
01:09:27,970 --> 01:09:32,715
And I felt it in the World Cup final going into the warm up.

1498
01:09:32,795 --> 01:09:33,736
Then in the game, I was good.

1499
01:09:34,537 --> 01:09:40,125
But running into my zone, the area, the box with the fans,

1500
01:09:40,967 --> 01:09:44,955
It was like, oh my God, I feel like something I never felt before.

1501
01:09:45,175 --> 01:09:47,300
Even nowadays, playing big games, I never...

1502
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,182
I'm not feeling that.

1503
01:09:48,202 --> 01:09:48,463
What was it?

1504
01:09:48,523 --> 01:09:48,804
Nerves?

1505
01:09:49,225 --> 01:09:50,088
Anxiety?

1506
01:09:50,188 --> 01:09:50,510
Energy?

1507
01:09:50,891 --> 01:09:51,352
Not as...

1508
01:09:51,713 --> 01:09:57,587
You know when you're nervous in a game, you want to go to the toilet maybe, or maybe you go buy flights, you know that?

1509
01:09:58,228 --> 01:10:02,772
feeling in this one which is a heat inside your body like burning inside weird

1510
01:10:03,433 --> 01:10:08,173
that's honestly I knew I was looking forward to it we were looking forward to it but how good was that

1511
01:10:08,675 --> 01:10:09,036
The best.

1512
01:10:09,257 --> 01:10:09,698
The best.

1513
01:10:09,918 --> 01:10:10,881
Emi, you're the man.

1514
01:10:10,981 --> 01:10:12,124
Kurt, you're not bad either.

1515
01:10:13,266 --> 01:10:14,128
It's been The False Cast.

1516
01:10:14,189 --> 01:10:14,870
I hope you enjoyed it.

1517
01:10:14,890 --> 01:10:15,412
We'll see you soon.
