1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,240
This is now the craziest video I’ve ever made.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,560
And it’s been 12 hours.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,640
Argentina’s always that way.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,880
Aah f*ck.

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,680
What just happened Eli?

6
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,600
Ummmm...

7
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,440
No, my word’s aren’t going to do it justice.

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,760
Roll the tape.

9
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,400
My name’s Eli Mengem and for the past few years

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,040
I’ve been traversing Europe, documenting the tales

11
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,080
of football clubs and their fanbases

12
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,760
who’ve been on the verge of winning something

13
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,440
for the first time in a long time...

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,760
If not ever.

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,800
From Northern Turkey

16
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,080
to Southern Spain.

17
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,280
From South West Germany

18
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,560
to the Basque country.

19
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,160
I’ve been on a mission to show how important it is

20
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,120
that the game has a variety of winners

21
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,800
so that we learn about new places,

22
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,600
new people,

23
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,400
new cultures,

24
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,400
and most importantly, new stories.

25
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,400
Then came the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

26
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,000
Where I knew the exact “Once In A Lifetime” story I had to tell.

27
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,040
So as the world’s media descended on Qatar

28
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,360
to be at the tournament.

29
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,360
COPA90 and I decided to fly 8000 miles in the opposite direction

30
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,080
to tell the ultimate story of a football fanbase

31
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,600
on the brink of ending a 36 year wait

32
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,080
for the biggest prize in sport.

33
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,240
But what we found we found was a story that transcended football.

34
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,560
A story that reached into the very soul of a nation

35
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,120
that laid itself bare over two fateful weeks.

36
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,320
A story that etched a struggle for identity in a search for glory

37
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,320
that began over two centuries ago.

38
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,000
A story about Lionel Messi.

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,080
Argentina.

40
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,760
And 45 million people yearning to reclaim their place in history.

41
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,920
This is the all angle, on the ground,

42
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,920
as it happened, ultimate account

43
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,560
of perhaps the greatest football story of our time.

44
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,680
We’re good to go?

45
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,200
Yep?

46
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,040
We’re good?

47
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,520
O.K

48
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,440
What’s in a name?

49
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,160
Argentina?

50
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,680
Why’s this country called Argentina?

51
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,720
Argentina?

52
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,880
It comes from the Latin: Argentum

53
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,400
It means ‘Silver’

54
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,480
‘The Land Of Silver’

55
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,840
The assumption of the first Europeans who went over there

56
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,320
was that it would be this incredibly rich country.

57
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,480
As they found in Mexico.

58
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,640
As they found in Peru.

59
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,840
Because the Spanish conquistadors

60
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,440
they thought they were going to find a lot of silver here.

61
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,520
And you know Mexico and Peru had led to

62
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,840
enormous amounts of gold being shipped across the Atlantic.

63
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,880
It leads to incredible inflation in Europe.

64
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,440
In fact they named the river...

65
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,880
as the ‘River Plate’.

66
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,560
‘Plate’ is another word for silver.

67
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,520
ELI: ‘Plata?’

68
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,120
- Yeah.

69
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,720
Plata = Silver.

70
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,160
ELI: Well did they find lots of ‘Plata’? What did they find?

71
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,720
Nothing.

72
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,440
The name itself is a myth.

73
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,600
Empty land.

74
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,520
A few natives.

75
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,480
Well the Indigenous people, we know why they’re not there.

76
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,840
Cause they were... it was a genocide.

77
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,160
I mean that’s the only word for it.

78
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,400
They were slaughtered.

79
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,240
Nothing here resembles silver.

80
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,560
It was the other way around.

81
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,040
Since it’s beginnings

82
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,880
Argentina’s been obsessed with unattainable fortunes.

83
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,360
We think we’re in the ‘Land Of Silver’

84
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,840
but we are in the land of...

85
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,960
corrugated carbon.

86
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,640
Yeah, Argentina has this...

87
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,840
people often say: “The delusion of grandeur”.

88
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,320
I am not a sociologist.

89
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,800
I cannot explain where this is coming from.

90
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,320
But...

91
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,400
I think there is a sense of entitlement

92
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,720
which is not warranted.

93
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,760
But for all its false promises,

94
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,120
there was one period where the country lived up to its

95
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,120
lofty expectations.

96
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,760
If you go back, nearly a century or so...

97
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,920
You want me to put a date?

98
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,880
1880 - 1930

99
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,120
It was, one of the wealthiest countries in the world.

100
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,560
The Argentine.

101
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,840
Now known as one of the richest countries in the world.

102
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,000
The international economic situation was

103
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,600
very favourable for Argentina.

104
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,880
It’s GDP was on a par with Australia

105
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,640
and many of the new world countries.

106
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,200
Argentina had all the comparative advantages to develop.

107
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,280
Which was like this,

108
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,800
we have something to offer to the world.

109
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,520
You know, it’s got huge amounts of farmland.

110
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,240
With the new refrigeration technology

111
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,640
a century ago we’re talking about,

112
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,680
they were about to export beef to the European market,

113
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,040
the North American market.

114
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,720
Today the Argentine exports more cattle and hide

115
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,360
than any other country in the world.

116
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,280
It wasn't just beef, I would say it was also agriculture.

117
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,480
I mean basically we have incredibly fertile land.

118
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,400
Like all of the “Pampa Humeda”

119
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,840
which covers quite a lot of central Buenos Aires (state)

120
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,920
and around Santa Fe

121
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,520
have perfect conditions for agriculture.

122
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,960
We were feeding the world, practically.

123
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,640
And that made Argentina...

124
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,280
a remarkably wealthy country.

125
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,120
I mean, there's communications between

126
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,240
the British and US government saying:

127
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,360
Argentina really is the coming place and maybe we should

128
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,840
think of sort of nudging Canada aside and

129
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,440
putting Argentina in Canada’s place.

130
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,600
Because Argentina was a very attractive destination.

131
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,240
And so with such abundant wealth

132
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,800
came those in search of it.

133
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,160
New contingents of immigrants arrive to Buenos Aires

134
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,640
after 18 happy days of navigation.

135
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,960
It was a wonderful place to come

136
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,680
because you had the opportunity to prosper.

137
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,680
They come for a better destiny,

138
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,400
for a destiny that gives them back the primary joy of living.

139
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,800
Relative to the size of the population we had

140
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,760
for a period of time, more immigrants than the Americans.

141
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,200
This influx was an exclusively European migration

142
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,400
where the new arrivals hailed from all over the continent

143
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,680
be it Spanish, French or even Russian.

144
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,000
But the most significant arrivals were the Italians.

145
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,120
Arriving is 940 Italians.

146
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,320
 Almost a thousand men, women and children

147
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,440
 who have left a life behind to begin the new stage 

148
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,120
to a warm welcome of peace. 

149
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,800
And with migration of the early 1900’s predominately by boat

150
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,880
naturally the vast majority of Italian migrants

151
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,600
came from Italy’s port cities.

152
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,320
Many from the Northern Italian port city of Genoa

153
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,880
but the majority from the Southern port city of Naples.

154
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,760
You know what the nickname of Italians are here?

155
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,640
How do we call Italians?

156
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,280
“Tanos”

157
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,280
You know why?

158
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,840
For Napoletano.

159
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,880
That’s the reason.

160
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,200
Most of them came from the South (of Italy)

161
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,720
and we identify them with Naples.

162
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,520
I tend to agree with people that say

163
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,960
that Argentinians are Italian people

164
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,880
speaking in Spanish.

165
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,560
Buenos Aires itself is very linked to Italy

166
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,520
and particularly to Southern Italy

167
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,080
and particularly to Naples.

168
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,240
You see that in the accent.

169
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,480
You see that in the slang.

170
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,040
The rhythm...

171
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,640
it’s more Italian.

172
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,920
It’s got a sort of sing-song quality like Italian.

173
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,560
And that’s obviously the Italian influence.

174
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,040
You see that in the cuisine.

175
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,040
There’s a large Italian influence there.

176
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,680
Pasta.

177
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,600
Pizza.

178
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,360
Cold Cuts.

179
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,160
They came and they conquered

180
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,440
the people’s palates.

181
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,600
And you know if you look at the architecture.

182
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,120
The Italian architecture legacy which is either

183
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,360
these very grand ornate buildings

184
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,240
and then you have the more modest, single story dwellings.

185
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,040
Which were called “PH’s”.

186
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,160
When you’re in Buenos Aires you can be in a really run down area

187
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,560
and suddenly you turn a corner

188
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,320
and there’s this incredibly beautiful square

189
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,480
that makes you feel like you’re in a remote town in Italy.

190
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,120
So, the Italians

191
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,360
I think they really left their mark

192
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,800
in our culture.

193
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,640
But this influence wasn’t just confined to accent and architecture

194
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,520
especially in Argentina’s capital...

195
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,160
where a distinct ‘way of being’ was imported

196
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,920
directly from Italy’s south.

197
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,720
Buenos Aires is closer to Naples than to any other European city

198
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,520
ELI: What do you mean in?

199
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,320
Culturally.

200
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,440
The way we interact with each other.

201
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,440
I feel like this a country of extroverts.

202
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,560
They’re warm. They’re lovely, but they...

203
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,680
They’re really in your face.

204
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,240
So Argentinians are very expressive, it’s like:

205
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,320
They get quite hot headed.

206
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,720
They get quite passionate.

207
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,400
And they use their hands.

208
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,560
Name two players whoever played with Maradona!

209
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,120
We think we have the power to say to shy people:

210
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,360
'How can you be like that?'

211
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,120
That’s why it was a perfect fit for Maradona, Naples.

212
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,720
Because, they are like us.

213
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:12,440
Look, we're mostly descendants of Latinos: Italians and Spaniards.

214
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:17,400
But I believe we've surpassed even their emotionality.

215
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,720
We added what we called the 'Argenta quota'.

216
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,640
Yeah, they’re passionate about everything they do.

217
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,320
Passion is lived differently here.

218
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,240
We have passion in our blood.

219
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,480
They’re passionate about their politics

220
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,960
Oh the obsession with (ex president) Peron is extraordinary.

221
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,000
You mention JFK but the Argentinian obsession with Peron is

222
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,080
way more extreme than that.

223
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,520
They’re passionate about their literature.

224
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,000
There’s a big book scene here.

225
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,360
And they still consume a lot of paper printed material.

226
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,800
You will always find a bookstore.

227
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,040
For many, many years we’ve had like

228
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,720
more bookstores per capita

229
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,120
than anywhere else in the world.

230
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,680
Their passionate about their music.

231
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,000
Tango is a very good example of our passion for music.

232
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,920
Carlos Gardel who is the most famous tango singer

233
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,200
you’ll see portraits of him all around the city.

234
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,240
you’ll see portraits of him all around the city.

235
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,200
you’ll see portraits of him all around the city.

236
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,680
Yeah one of the things about Argentinian society, everything is...

237
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,520
It’s extremes.

238
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,080
Absolutely, absolutely.

239
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,520
It’s a country of extremes.

240
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,680
I don’t know if they like to over exaggerate

241
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,840
but everything is like grandiose and amazing.

242
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,440
And yeah, I suppose there is quite a bit of...

243
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:17,920
A bit of that.

244
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,960
The best, the biggest, the longest.

245
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,640
Any superlative, they’ve got it.

246
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,840
Yes, sometimes we feel...

247
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,640
a little sense of superiority.

248
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,440
The best steak.

249
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,800
Yes, best steak in the world.

250
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,400
I couldn’t think of a better steak elsewhere

251
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,680
than in Argentina.

252
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,200
The thing with steak is like

253
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,080
our entry level is so high...

254
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,360
that we’re just spoilt.

255
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,160
The best wine.

256
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,840
The wine here is insanely good.

257
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,120
The Malbec for sure.

258
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,920
There are some wines that even surprise the French.

259
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,040
The widest Avenue in the world.

260
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,880
Yes, the widest...

261
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,280
and the longest as well!

262
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,760
Many Argentines are proud to say that they feel that

263
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,360
we’ve perfected the Gelato.

264
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,440
Yeah, it’s a...

265
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,040
It’s a very, very passionate place.

266
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,680
So how does an Argentinian commit s*icide?

267
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,360
He jumps from his ego.

268
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,480
I think we’ve got the best ice cream.

269
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,080
ELI: Better than the Italians?

270
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,520
Yes.

271
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,760
No. No. No.

272
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,840
Yes.

273
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,640
Best ice cream is in Argentina.

274
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,760
Yes. It really is.

275
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,880
You see in Argentina passion isn’t so much a hobby as a way of life.

276
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,560
Best summed up in one the country’s most iconic films.

277
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,240
And whilst everything and anything Argentinians care about

278
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,600
is met with heightened levels of passion and adoration,

279
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,120
there is one subject the country’s most passionate about.

280
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,240
In all the world this is the place where football is lived in the

281
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,400
most passionate and popular way.

282
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,760
You couldn’t have Argentina without football.

283
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,640
I think in a way it’s just become part of its...

284
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,040
psyche.

285
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,320
Of its elemental being.

286
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,960
We define ourselves and quite often

287
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,520
analyse our life through football.

288
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,080
I mean football is...

289
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,000
is Argentina.

290
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,520
Football is what moves Argentina the most.

291
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,960
We place our daily joy on football.

292
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,480
The country lives football.

293
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,520
A baby is born， and then a year later we give him a football.

294
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,640
This is the football country.

295
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,280
But then let me ask you, why Argentina?

296
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,560
Why do you think Argentina got so hooked?

297
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,040
You’ve got other sports, but football is the be all and end all.

298
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,840
It’s like water here, it’s just omnipresent.

299
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,760
Let's split this in two factions.

300
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,880
First, there's the sport...

301
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,600
and secondly, there's the passion that the sport represents.

302
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,000
Because basically the effect football has on people...

303
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,600
no other sport contains it.

304
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,800
You see when you’ve got a population as passionate as Argentina

305
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,120
it only makes sense that they made

306
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,520
the most passionate and emotional game theirs.

307
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:15,600
There’s a relationship between Argentinian idiosyncrasy

308
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,960
and the nature of football as a sport.

309
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,600
There’s a characteristic of Argentina

310
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,760
that comes out through football.

311
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,440
Argentinian mentality and culture

312
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,960
and the dynamics of football.

313
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
It’s like a perfect match.

314
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,320
Think about it like this:

315
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,080
Football is a low scoring game.

316
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,080
So, you build up a lot of anxiety.

317
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,600
You build up a lot of momentum.

318
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,440
But when the actual moment arrives

319
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,200
The goal!

320
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,880
It’s an explosion.

321
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,440
I’m going to use this expression.

322
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,360
It’s like an orgasm.

323
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,800
There is something magical, something....

324
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,960
intrinsic about football.

325
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,800
It’s something that no other sports have.

326
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:15,160
If you go to a game here， any game， even if you go alone，

327
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,760
when a team scores a goal， a stranger will hug you.

328
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,400
You'll never celebrate on your own.

329
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,920
Even the shyest person of all

330
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,240
will end up standing up and hugging a stranger.

331
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,040
Because I think Argentinians have many flaws

332
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,080
and things to improve as a society,

333
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,240
but there's something we're very proud of...

334
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,160
our ability to share joy.

335
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,320
But it’s not just the uniquely emotional

336
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,520
and passionate elements of football

337
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,360
that make this game so important to Argentina.

338
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,880
In 1913 there’s a series of lectures

339
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,520
at the Odeon theatre in Buenos Aires.

340
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,880
Given by Leopoldo Lugones who is the national poet.

341
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,200
The president goes, lots of very senior figures,

342
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,720
everyone goes to these lectures.

343
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,520
This is the national poet talking about national character.

344
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,680
Who are we?

345
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:06,200
And he concludes that the spirit of Argentina is best represented

346
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,240
by the Gaucho.

347
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,440
The cowboy who made sure the huge herds of cattle were safe.

348
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,360
And from the huge herds of cattle you get the beef.

349
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,480
And from the beef you get the wealth.

350
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,480
So the Gaucho is massively important.

351
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,560
And also the Gaucho is a...

352
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,760
it’s a very romantic figure.

353
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,120
There’s a reason why cowboy films are popular.

354
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,960
Because the cowboy is glamorous.

355
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,280
In all the world of romance and adventure.

356
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,400
There’s none to compare with the Gaucho.

357
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,480
He’s battling the elements, he’s battling wild animals.

358
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,920
He’s got this great virtuosity.

359
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,320
And so you get Gaucho clubs set up.

360
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,400
And they all dress up.

361
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,320
They dress to what they think Gauchos look like.

362
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,680
They put on these big barbecues.

363
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,160
One of the reasons the Asado, the great barbecues are still

364
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,520
an absolute centre piece of Argentinian social life.

365
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,520
The Gaucho was romanticised in books.

366
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,440
It was romanticised in music.

367
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,400
And also because of the way they dressed, so...

368
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,840
The Gaucho for sure was super important.

369
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,240
And then the British wipe them out.

370
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,720
And the way they wipe them out is by introducing wire fencing.

371
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,560
If you have wire fencing you can do selective breeding.

372
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,040
And if you can do selective breeding

373
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,040
you get a higher meat yield

374
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,120
and you can make greater profits.

375
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,560
And this absolutely revolutionises Argentinian farming

376
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,920
and thus Argentinian society.

377
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,120
So economically, eventually the Gaucho and his influence

378
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,960
is wiped out.

379
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,560
So you then have the question.

380
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,320
Where do you find the Gaucho...

381
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,000
in an urban environment?

382
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,280
So El Grafico, one of the world’s great sports magazines.

383
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,440
At it’s peak it was selling, I think, over 100,000 copies

384
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,880
across South America

385
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,480
every week.

386
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,520
El Grafico was born in 1919

387
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:46,080
and it ran until January 2018 so...

388
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,080
99 years.

389
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,640
It was this revered magazine product,

390
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,000
bible of sport.

391
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,440
Whatever you want to call it, but it was very special.

392
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,720
Many people learned to read with El Grafico

393
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,240
It’s not a football magazine

394
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,960
as in a glossy thing with a couple of interviews.

395
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,480
It really goes into detail.

396
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,800
Maradona first met Pele in a production

397
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,360
specifically for El Grafico.

398
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,560
Muhammad Ali came to Argentina

399
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,240
invited by El Grafico.

400
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,160
It was like football’s Rolling Stone Magazine.

401
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,960
So El Grafico:

402
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,080
They say that spirit of the Gaucho.

403
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,000
That combination of toughness

404
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,120
cunning, cleverness, virtuosity and glamour...

405
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,640
Where do you find that?

406
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,960
And they say you find that in the ‘Pibe’.

407
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,880
The Pibe is the urchin child of the streets.

408
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,400
He learns the game on the potreros, on the vacant lots of the city.

409
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,720
The ‘Potrero’ is more than a football pitch.

410
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,800
It’s the imagination of a football pitch in an...

411
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,400
unthinkable terrain.

412
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,160
They’re on very uneven surfaces

413
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,840
so you have to have this technical virtuosity to control the ball.

414
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,240
That could be full of holes,

415
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,680
stones,

416
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,600
glass.

417
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,520
They are often very crowded

418
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,400
too many people playing in too small a space.

419
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,240
It’s dirt.

420
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,440
It’s also tackles.

421
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,520
It’s also no referee.

422
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,320
At the schools, you have a teacher with a whistle

423
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,480
to stop things if it gets out of hand.

424
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,440
In the potreros...

425
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,960
You have to be able to look after yourself.

426
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,640
You have to have that cunning, that street wiseness.

427
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,000
This is the place in which many talents...

428
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,120
couldn’t survive.

429
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,440
So this is 1928, Borocoto is the Editor of El Grafico.

430
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,600
A Pibe with a dirty face.

431
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,440
A mane of hair rebelling against the comb,

432
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,440
with intelligent, roving, trickster and persuasive eyes

433
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,960
and a sparkling gaze that seems to hint a picturesque laugh

434
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,760
that does not quite manage to fall in his mouth.

435
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,080
His trousers are a few roughly sewn patches.

436
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,880
His vest with Argentinian stripes.

437
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,120
With a very low neck and with very many holes eaten out

438
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,680
by the invisible mice of use.

439
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,400
Barefoot or with shoes, his holes in the toes

440
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,040
suggest they’ve been made through too much shooting.

441
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,000
His stance must be characteristic as if he is dribbling with a rag ball.

442
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,840
If this monument is raised one day,

443
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,040
there will be many of us who take off our hat to it

444
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,280
as we do in church.

445
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,200
Now this is 1928.

446
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,280
And what he’s given you there, if you take that extract,

447
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,560
and you don’t give people any context and say who is that?

448
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,400
It’s Diego Maradona.

449
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,960
It’s obviously Diego Maradona.

450
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,440
49 years before Maradona makes his international debut.

451
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,200
32 years before Maradona’s born.

452
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,480
He predicts the coming of Maradona.

453
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,560
And that’s why when Maradona arrives

454
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,880
immediately he’s celebrated because people have recognised...

455
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,520
This...

456
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,520
This is the saviour we were promised.

457
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,080
You knew in your head he would save you.

458
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,560
And that’s why he becomes ‘El Pibe D’oro’.

459
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,600
The Golden Pibe.

460
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,960
Maradona’s importance to Argentina is greater than

461
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,560
the significance of any one sporting figure

462
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,640
to any other nation.

463
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,920
I mean Maradona exists

464
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,320
on a totally different plane in Argentina

465
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,400
to anybody else.

466
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,000
A man who adorns nearly every corner

467
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,480
of the country’s neighbourhoods.

468
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,960
A man responsible for a significant percentage

469
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,600
of the male population being called Diego.

470
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,960
A man who inspired a religion

471
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,440
boasting tens of thousands of members

472
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,000
all around the country.

473
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,080
Yeah whenever I have to light a candle for something

474
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,320
I do it in Diego's name.

475
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,880
When I need to ask for something, I ask to Diego.

476
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,120
Maradona was larger than life...

477
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,840
period.

478
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,960
But for anyone left who still doesn’t know,

479
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,240
Diego Armando Maradona was the man who in 1986

480
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,360
led an un-fancied Argentinian side

481
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,400
to their second ever World Cup trophy.

482
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,280
No one saw that he was going to put

483
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,520
such an individual performance

484
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,880
that a team that just a few days before the World Cup

485
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,160
was performing very poorly

486
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,560
and no one had hopes about it…

487
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,720
will transform it into a winning team.

488
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,400
It’s a single moment, it’s a single World Cup

489
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,480
where, like, one player has grabbed the tournament

490
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,200
by the scruff of the neck

491
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,000
and won it.

492
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,200
That’s only happened once in the history of the game.

493
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,120
Of the World Cup.

494
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,920
That was the magic of Maradona.

495
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,080
All of which led to nationwide scenes and emotions

496
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,200
the country had never experienced.

497
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,880
It’s the greatest day in Argentinian football history

498
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,120
no, not even...

499
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,080
nothing is even close.

500
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,360
You look at the celebrations after the final and

501
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,440
It’s extraordinary. It’s millions of people on the street.

502
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,840
These mass celebrations.

503
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,280
People were like moving cars.

504
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,480
They were so happy that they were moving cars, literally.

505
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,040
And for as far as you can see it’s people.

506
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,440
Blue and white shirts everywhere.

507
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,600
I think winning that World Cup was almost as big as

508
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,400
getting democracy back in ‘83.

509
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,200
And whilst yes Argentina had won one other World Cup in 1978.

510
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,360
That was won during a time the country were under

511
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,600
a despised military dictatorship.

512
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,960
It was a fantastic victory the 1978 World Cup

513
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,240
but there was always a dark cloud.

514
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,120
Because of the military rulers of the time.

515
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,920
And so over time it was that 1986 win

516
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,800
that became a unique symbol of Argentine utopia.

517
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,280
That thing that surrounds that World Cup.

518
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,720
That mythology.

519
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,560
It will never be, it cannot be....

520
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,760
replicated.

521
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,480
And whilst Argentinians fondly remember

522
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,120
every moment of that tournament.

523
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,480
There’s one particular game from Mexico 86

524
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,960
that’s remembered most fondly.

525
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,080
Maradona scored against England.

526
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,160
That's the whole thing.

527
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,520
The goal against England

528
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,720
That's what it's about.

529
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,200
That is the question.

530
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,480
Now there are many reasons why

531
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,720
this match means so much to Argentina.

532
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,400
Firstly off the pitch.

533
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,760
On a day, May 4th, 1982.

534
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,920
That brought the reality of war into Britain’s dispute with Argentina

535
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,800
over the Falkland Islands.

536
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,320
Then there’s that game’s meaning on the pitch.

537
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,760
Where Maradona scored both of Argentina’s goals.

538
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,120
The first being one of the game’s most controversial.

539
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,800
The 'Mano de Dios'

540
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,000
‘Hand of God'.

541
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,600
By cheating with his first goal, using a hand.

542
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,560
So, it was like now we were screwing the English.

543
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,520
And then, there was his second goal.

544
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,000
ELI: What was... what was the second goal?

545
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,840
No, no. I’m done.

546
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,240
Cut.

547
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:36,480
Cut.

548
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:36,760
Cut.

549
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,040
Cut.

550
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,200
ELI: I’m winding you up... I’m trying to get...

551
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,240
ELI: I know about it... It’s the best goal of all time, I know.

552
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,320
Only four minutes after the Hand of God,

553
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,280
Maradona collected the ball in his own half.

554
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,640
Beat five England players.

555
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,720
Rounded the keeper and scored what FIFA officially titled:

556
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,080
The Goal Of The Century.

557
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,520
When Maradona scores those two goals against England.

558
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,520
in the 1986 World Cup Quarter finals...

559
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,160
That is the Gaucho spirit, projected through football.

560
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,080
Because they represent the two sides of the Argentinian character.

561
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,600
The cunning of the first goal.

562
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,200
And the virtuosity of the second.

563
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,720
That’s why it means so much.

564
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,720
But as beautiful as that second goal was...

565
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,360
it’s actually the first, more controversial goal

566
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,120
that Argentinians hold dearest.

567
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,080
Best explaining their unique love of Maradona and the game.

568
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,680
I was saying that:

569
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:27,240
The first handball goal was more satisfying than the second goal.

570
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,840
It was more enjoyable.

571
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,320
'Viveza Criolla'.

572
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,240
And if there’s one term you need to know

573
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,640
to understand the spirit of Argentine football,

574
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,320
it’s that one.

575
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,680
How do you say it again?

576
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,760
Viveza Criolla.

577
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,640
Viveza Criolla?

578
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,640
What is it?

579
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,880
So if Brazilians live their football in Joga Bonito terms...

580
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,000
We have something different.

581
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,520
Something very different.

582
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,000
We call it:

583
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,080
Viveza.

584
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,400
Criolla.

585
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,720
It’s cunningness?

586
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,480
Yes. Pretty much.

587
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,400
Cunning would be a very...

588
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,560
‘polite’

589
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,160
‘nice’ way to describe Viveza Criolla.

590
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,120
Being smart enough to find a way through stuff

591
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,800
but also a little bit

592
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,080
doing something a little bit illegal.

593
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,280
Cause it means both cleverness, streetwise-ness

594
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,280
cynicism even.

595
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,440
It's the satisfaction of winning by deceit.

596
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,200
It's the satisfaction of doing something illegal

597
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,560
Do you struggle with it?

598
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,240
Because you love beautiful football?

599
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,240
I mean I do love beautiful football

600
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,480
but I also like winning, you know?

601
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,320
It means just sort of being smarter than...

602
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,120
the opponent.

603
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,160
I can tell you this.

604
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,160
We have an immense satisfaction in this country

605
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,840
that he scored that goal with his hand.

606
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,800
I don’t think that distinction is obvious

607
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,120
to people from Argentinian culture.

608
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,920
It was a shock for me to realise that:

609
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,480
Outside Argentina that was perceived as a terrible thing.

610
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,840
As cheating.

611
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,480
Argentinians, they also don’t seemed particularly ashamed by that?

612
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,280
They kind of take it in their stride.

613
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,120
Why?

614
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,880
Well, because this notion of Viveza Criolla

615
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,840
it encompasses...

616
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,240
they do not see a distinction between

617
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,040
tricking somebody by moving your feet really quickly

618
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,960
or doing a feint with your body

619
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,000
and...

620
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,880
drugging them.

621
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,160
That of course is a reference to arguably

622
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,960
the one act of Viveza Criolla

623
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,800
more infamous than the Hand of God.

624
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,040
Masterminded in 1990 by the professor of Viveza Criolla

625
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,760
Carlos Bilardo.

626
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,040
Manager of Argentina’s 1986 World Cup winning side.

627
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,720
The truth is, nobody knows...

628
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,840
but it is very strongly rumoured

629
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,640
and not denied at all by Bilardo

630
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,760
that they spiked Brazil’s water bottles.

631
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,360
Put some kind of sedative in the water.

632
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,360
And Branco drank from it.

633
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
The Brazilian player?

634
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,720
Yeah, the leftback.

635
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,760
And he was woozy throughout the rest of the game.

636
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,080
Don’t drink out of that one!

637
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,880
Bilardo as a player famously would take pins on the pitch

638
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,560
to stab players he was marking.

639
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,880
He’d stick a needle in his sock

640
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,480
and take it out at the corner kick

641
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,160
and just stab opposing players with it.

642
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,960
And that was nothing.

643
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,240
That was like...

644
00:25:59,240 --> 00:25:59,880
That was nothing.

645
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,640
Bilardo was a qualified gynaecologist

646
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,160
and he had contacts from the world of gynaecology and from them

647
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,040
he would find out things about players girlfriends and wives

648
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,480
and he’d use that to wind them up on the pitch.

649
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,640
So Roberto Perfumo.

650
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,360
The great Argentinian centre back.

651
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,680
He was sent off for punching Bilardo in the face

652
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,200
supposedly because Bilardo started talking to him about

653
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,280
a problem that Perfumo’s wife was having.

654
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,600
Bilardo, Maradona and their Viveza Criolla spirit

655
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,960
took Argentina to another World Cup final four years later

656
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,480
before Argentina won two Copa Americas in a row.

657
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,920
They win the Copa America in ‘91 & ’93.

658
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,400
And then suddenly, 94...

659
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,560
they stop the getting results.

660
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,280
But by this point Argentina had tasted such success

661
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,480
on the international stage

662
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,320
that expectations at every tournament

663
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,760
were now raised to unrealistic levels.

664
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,520
I think the yearning for success from Argentina

665
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,280
I think it’s very hard to...

666
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,320
overestimate.

667
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,320
You go to the world cup with expectations

668
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,280
thinking we're always going to get to the final and win.

669
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,080
The 1986 World Cup immediately became

670
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,680
the bar that everything was

671
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,240
to be compared with that moment.

672
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,680
I mean we always have to win the World Cup.

673
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,680
That’s how I grew up.

674
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,320
ELI: Why?

675
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,680
Because the first one I saw we won it

676
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,640
and I thought it was the normal thing.

677
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,920
The normal state of affairs.

678
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,160
We had Maradona.

679
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,080
We won the World Cup.

680
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,160
We have to win it all the time.

681
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,680
And whilst from then on they weren’t still winning tournaments...

682
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,240
with a round of 16 appearance at World Cup ‘94,

683
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,440
a quarter final appearance in World Cup ‘98,

684
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,880
and two quarter final appearances at the Copa America.

685
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,600
it was hardly a disastrous era.

686
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,480
But for such a passionate nation who see the game

687
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,640
and particularly this tournament as part of their identity

688
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,360
well, rationality doesn’t play a role in expectations.

689
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,720
Perhaps for Morocco, a 4th place is extraordinary.

690
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,040
But in Argentina, even second place....

691
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,080
for many people it's a failure.

692
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,040
And so despite boasting many of the 90’s greatest footballers

693
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,280
each and every one floundered under the weight

694
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,720
of the memory of Maradona’s achievements.

695
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,040
However it’s not just football where Argentina’s weighed down

696
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,960
by nostalgia.

697
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,280
Argentines do live in the past.

698
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,400
And they’re pessimists about the future.

699
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,160
And they’re pessimists about the present.

700
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,880
But, they’re like...

701
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,800
very proud about the past.

702
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,840
There’s this real nostalgia for the 1920’s

703
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,120
which makes sense because that’s

704
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,640
when Argentina really mattered.

705
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,680
It’s a country that’s slow to modernise.

706
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,360
It’s a profoundly nostalgic culture.

707
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,520
It’s always harking back.

708
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,160
There’s a lot written about and researched about

709
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,880
what you can tell about a society through its national song.

710
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,160
And the Tango of course is this very passionate dance

711
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,520
but it’s also a very nostalgic dance.

712
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,400
It’s sort of infused with this sense of...

713
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,480
things were better in the past and this is all doomed.

714
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,120
The lyrics are about unrequited love, about...

715
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,880
dreams not materialising,

716
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,920
about yesteryear.

717
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,080
And that tells a lot about Argentine society as well.

718
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,320
You look at the architecture.

719
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,960
The architecture of Buenos Aires, all the good stuff

720
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,720
was done in the beginning of the 20th century or late 19th century.

721
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,320
The way the waiters dress.

722
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,800
They wear the white shirts, the black bowties, black aprons.

723
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,920
It’s harking back to how waiters were dressed in the 1920s.

724
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,560
But you look at some of the buses.

725
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,200
It’s artistry that belongs to the 50’s.

726
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,760
You know walking round the city you’ll see it,

727
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,960
from old fashioned stores to bars.

728
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,600
Anywhere in Argentina you’re going to get this,

729
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,440
but they’re like little snapshots and postcards to the past.

730
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,720
I mean, we’re doing this interview in a bar

731
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,880
that basically hasn’t changed it’s decor since the 1960’s so...

732
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,080
You’re already in a time warp.

733
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,280
Well, you tend to idealise the past, you know?

734
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,640
Memory, is a tricky thing.

735
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,320
In a nation, or in a country

736
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,680
where truly

737
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,120
back in the days

738
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,680
at least ‘materially speaking’

739
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,160
things were better.

740
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,320
That national tendency to glorify the past...

741
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,200
it becomes magnified.

742
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,920
And theres a reason it’s so magnified in Argentina

743
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,880
as it’s power and prestige of the 20th century

744
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,280
is anything but in the 21st century.

745
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,320
We are very far from the glory years of the beginning of last century

746
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,080
Now there is...

747
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,240
Beyond 55 per cent poverty in Argentina.

748
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,520
Argentina is now more synonymous

749
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,280
with economic crises and crashes than

750
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,280
a prosperous new world country.

751
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,800
It’s gotten to the point where a lot people are deciding that

752
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,920
the only thing they can do is just

753
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,840
go away.

754
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,520
Leave the country.

755
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:08,295
argentina was a country that welcomed people

756
00:31:08,295 --> 00:31:09,720
from all over the world.

757
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,120
now people are being forced out.

758
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,080
The Argentine nation could have been

759
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,800
much more than it is, than it’s become

760
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,120
there’s all the questions about...

761
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,800
What happened? Where did it go wrong?

762
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,920
Corruption,

763
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,040
political institutions,

764
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,400
the culture of the people.

765
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,680
There’s lots of reasons.

766
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,000
It’s partly the repercussions of the Wall Street crash in 1929.

767
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,440
The reasons range from, political instability.

768
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,000
And of course, post 1930 the history of Argentina

769
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,840
has been coup after coup after coup after coup.

770
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,120
Sociological reasons.

771
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,680
Because here, people think that doing things by the book

772
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,640
makes you an idiot.

773
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,600
From political projects

774
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,680
The majority of the rest of the wealthy world signs up to GATT

775
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,520
the General Agreement on Tariffs and trades

776
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,240
which facilitated international trade

777
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,960
and Argentina remain aloof from that.

778
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,040
They don't sign up.

779
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,320
Simple answer?

780
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,560
ELI: Tell me your answer.

781
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,520
What changed is this...

782
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,440
The model that we had for development.

783
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,680
For economic development.

784
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,960
We actually had a name for it:

785
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,960
en modelo agroexportador

786
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,240
Latin America is rearranging itself in the new world market

787
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,480
and Argentina is becoming one of the main producers

788
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,280
of food and raw materials.

789
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,640
The reorientation generates a new economic pattern:

790
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,640
en modelo agroexportador

791
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,840
It stopped being useful.

792
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,760
Because the international situation changed.

793
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,600
It became about industrialisation.

794
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,680
It was no longer about exporting commodities.

795
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,920
The relative prices of what we had to offer went down.

796
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,040
And our main market, disappeared.

797
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,480
So all those things combined...

798
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,240
That was the problem.

799
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,080
And if you want to read a couple of books about it

800
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,480
I can recommend it to you.

801
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,240
No problem.

802
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,440
And so where does an extremely proud and passionate nation

803
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,480
who was once a dominant global force

804
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,240
look to to find a similar sense of importance in the world?

805
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,120
The World Game of course.

806
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,080
I think Argentina is unique in the way it celebrates football

807
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,320
and particularly the World Cup because the World Cup is...

808
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,560
It’s how Argentina expresses itself

809
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,680
to the world.

810
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:10,325
I think football is where we feel like a world power.

811
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,710
argentina still feels like a world power through foorball,

812
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,200
So the thing with the World Cup for Argentines is

813
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,920
it’s not just about football, just being the best at football.

814
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,480
It’s about being the best...

815
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,440
at something.

816
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,160
That is how they show their worth

817
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,000
or how they validate themselves

818
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,480
particularly to a European audience.

819
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,680
So while we may not dominate anymore, you know

820
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,280
on several fields, especially the industry.

821
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,760
We can actually say that football is the one thing

822
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,560
where we can still be the very, very, very best.

823
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,200
There is reality, an objective reality.

824
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,320
And then there is perception.

825
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,760
Every nation perceives itself in some way...

826
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,840
We perceive as ourselves as really, really good, and

827
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,000
the only time reality and perception match

828
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,960
is when we play football.

829
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,000
And then came the 2002 World Cup in Japan/South Korea

830
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,400
which played out just as the country fell to a new low.

831
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,520
Huge numbers of people

832
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,840
lost huge amounts of money.

833
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,160
The country was ravaged.

834
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,960
The economy is just devastated because they can’t pay their debt.

835
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,240
Mired in a 93 billion dollar debt to the IMF

836
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,440
demonstrations, riots and general chaos

837
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,920
sent the country into near societal collapse.

838
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,000
The only glimmer of light being...

839
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,240
Their best national team in decades

840
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,920
who under coach Marcelo Bielsa

841
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,120
went to the tournament filled with optimism.

842
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,240
But in 2002, they qualify brilliantly under Bielsa.

843
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,480
You know,

844
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,880
in such a great form.

845
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,000
In qualifying, they destroy everybody.

846
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,680
A lot of unbeaten games...

847
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,600
You know they’re favourites, they’re definitely favourites.

848
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,000
And then for the first time in forty years.

849
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,800
Argentina crashed out at the group stage.

850
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,920
Argentina’s best World Cup hope in decades fell at the first hurdle.

851
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,160
And so that mythological Argentine Utopia of ‘86

852
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,280
felt further away than ever.

853
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,720
And with it’s economy, government and streets in tatters...

854
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,560
it really felt like it was never coming back.

855
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,240
However, little did they know...

856
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,560
another Pibe had emerged.
